  ChatGPT"	['Xinyue Shen', 'Zeyuan Chen', 'Michael Backes', 'Yang Zhang']	2023-04-18 13:20:45+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08979v2	"The way users acquire information is undergoing a paradigm shift with the
advent of ChatGPT. Unlike conventional search engines, ChatGPT retrieves
knowledge from the model itself and generates answers for users. ChatGPT's
impressive question-answering (QA) capability has attracted more than 100
million users within a short period of time but has also raised concerns
regarding its reliability. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale
measurement of ChatGPT's reliability in the generic QA scenario with a
carefully curated set of 5,695 questions across ten datasets and eight domains.
We find that ChatGPT's reliability varies across different domains, especially
underperforming in law and science questions. We also demonstrate that system
roles, originally designed by OpenAI to allow users to steer ChatGPT's
behavior, can impact ChatGPT's reliability in an imperceptible way. We further
show that ChatGPT is vulnerable to adversarial examples, and even a single
character change can negatively affect its reliability in certain cases. We
believe that our study provides valuable insights into ChatGPT's reliability
and underscores the need for strengthening the reliability and security of
large language models (LLMs)."	ArXiv

detectors to mitigate potential risks, including misinformation, phishing, and
academic dishonesty. Despite this, most previous studies have been
predominantly geared towards creating detectors that differentiate between
purely ChatGPT-generated texts and human-authored texts. This approach,
however, fails to work on discerning texts generated through human-machine
collaboration, such as ChatGPT-polished texts. Addressing this gap, we
introduce a novel dataset termed HPPT (ChatGPT-polished academic abstracts),
facilitating the construction of more robust detectors. It diverges from extant
corpora by comprising pairs of human-written and ChatGPT-polished abstracts
instead of purely ChatGPT-generated texts. Additionally, we propose the ""Polish
Ratio"" method, an innovative measure of the degree of modification made by
ChatGPT compared to the original human-written text. It provides a mechanism to
measure the degree of ChatGPT influence in the resulting text. Our experimental
results show our proposed model has better robustness on the HPPT dataset and
two existing datasets (HC3 and CDB). Furthermore, the ""Polish Ratio"" we
proposed offers a more comprehensive explanation by quantifying the degree of

Yet, it is still unclear if this boosting effect sustains with and without
ChatGPT. In a pre-registered seven-day lab experiment and a follow-up survey
after 30 days of experiment completion, we examined the impacts of ChatGPT
presence and absence on sustained creativity using a text dataset of 3302
creative ideas and 427 creative solutions from 61 college students.
Participants in the treatment group used ChatGPT in creative tasks, while those
in the control group completed the tasks by themselves. The findings show that
although the boosting effect of ChatGPT was consistently observed over a
five-day creative journey, human creative performance reverted to baseline when
ChatGPT was down on the 7th and the 30th day. More critically, the use of
ChatGPT in creative tasks resulted in increasingly homogenized contents, and
this homogenization effect persisted even when ChatGPT was absence. These
findings pose a challenge to the prevailing argument that ChatGPT can enhance
human creativity. In fact, generative AI like ChatGPT lends to human with a
temporary rise in creative performance but boxes human creative capability in
the long run, highlighting the imperative for cautious generative AI
integration in creative endeavors."	ArXiv

such as ChatGPT using publicly available dataset. We carry out an extensive
technical evaluation of ChatGPT using Big-Vul covering five different common
software vulnerability tasks. We evaluate the multitask and multilingual
aspects of ChatGPT based on this dataset. We found that the existing
state-of-the-art methods are generally superior to ChatGPT in software
vulnerability detection. Although ChatGPT improves accuracy when providing
context information, it still has limitations in accurately predicting severity
ratings for certain CWE types. In addition, ChatGPT demonstrates some ability
in locating vulnerabilities for certain CWE types, but its performance varies
among different CWE types. ChatGPT exhibits limited vulnerability repair
capabilities in both providing and not providing context information. Finally,
ChatGPT shows uneven performance in generating CVE descriptions for various CWE
types, with limited accuracy in detailed information. Overall, though ChatGPT
performs well in some aspects, it still needs improvement in understanding the
subtle differences in code vulnerabilities and the ability to describe
vulnerabilities in order to fully realize its potential. Our evaluation
framework provides valuable insights for further enhancing ChatGPT' s software
vulnerability handling capabilities."	ArXiv

ability from text reading. However, there has not been any direct comparison
between human readers and ChatGPT in reasoning ability related to text reading.
This study was undertaken to investigate how ChatGPTs (i.e., ChatGPT and
ChatGPT Plus) and Chinese senior school students as ESL learners exhibited
their reasoning ability from English narrative texts. Additionally, we compared
the two ChatGPTs in the reasoning performances when commands were updated
elaborately. The whole study was composed of three reasoning tests: Test 1 for
commonsense inference, Test 2 for emotional inference, and Test 3 for causal
inference. The results showed that in Test 1, the students outdid the two
ChatGPT versions in local-culture-related inferences but performed worse than
the chatbots in daily-life inferences. In Test 2, ChatGPT Plus excelled whereas
ChatGPT lagged behind in accuracy. In association with both accuracy and
frequency of correct responses, the students were inferior to the two chatbots.
Compared with ChatGPTs' better performance in positive emotions, the students
showed their superiority in inferring negative emotions. In Test 3, the
students demonstrated better logical analysis, outdoing both chatbots. In
updating command condition, ChatGPT Plus displayed good causal reasoning
ability while ChatGPT kept unchanged. Our study reveals that human readers and

academic and industrial communities. ChatGPT is able to respond effectively to
a wide range of human questions, providing fluent and comprehensive answers
that significantly surpass previous public chatbots in terms of security and
usefulness. On one hand, people are curious about how ChatGPT is able to
achieve such strength and how far it is from human experts. On the other hand,
people are starting to worry about the potential negative impacts that large
language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT could have on society, such as fake news,
plagiarism, and social security issues. In this work, we collected tens of
thousands of comparison responses from both human experts and ChatGPT, with
questions ranging from open-domain, financial, medical, legal, and
psychological areas. We call the collected dataset the Human ChatGPT Comparison
Corpus (HC3). Based on the HC3 dataset, we study the characteristics of
ChatGPT's responses, the differences and gaps from human experts, and future
directions for LLMs. We conducted comprehensive human evaluations and
linguistic analyses of ChatGPT-generated content compared with that of humans,
where many interesting results are revealed. After that, we conduct extensive
experiments on how to effectively detect whether a certain text is generated by
ChatGPT or humans. We build three different detection systems, explore several
key factors that influence their effectiveness, and evaluate them in different
scenarios. The dataset, code, and models are all publicly available at

2022 has brought considerable attention to the subject of artificial
intelligence, not only in the public. From the perspective of higher education,
ChatGPT challenges various learning and assessment formats as it significantly
reduces the effectiveness of their learning and assessment functionalities. In
particular, ChatGPT might be applied to formats that require learners to
generate text, such as bachelor theses or student research papers. Accordingly,
the research question arises to what extent writing of bachelor theses is still
a valid learning and assessment format. Correspondingly, in this study, the
first author was asked to write his bachelor's thesis exploiting ChatGPT. For
tracing the impact of ChatGPT, methodically an autoethnographic approach was
used. First, all considerations on the potential use of ChatGPT were documented
in logs and secondly, all ChatGPT chats were logged. Both logs and chat
histories were analyzed and are presented along to the recommendations for
students regarding the use of ChatGPT suggested by Gimpel et al. (2023). In
conclusion, ChatGPT is beneficial in thesis writing during various activities,
such as brainstorming, structuring and text revision. However, there arise
limitations, e.g., in referencing. Thus, ChatGPT requires a continuous
validation of the outcomes generated fostering learning. Currently, ChatGPT is
to be valued as a beneficial tool in thesis writing. However, writing a
conclusive thesis still requires the learner's meaningful engagement.
Accordingly, writing a thesis is still a valid learning and assessment format.
With further releases of ChatGPT, an increase in capabilities is to be expected
and the research question needs to be reevaluated from time to time."	ArXiv

  Lesson Planning"	['Gyeong-Geon Lee', 'Xiaoming Zhai']	2024-01-18 22:52:04+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01674v1	"Despite the buzz around ChatGPT's potential, empirical studies exploring its
actual utility in the classroom for learning remain scarce. This study aims to
fill this gap by analyzing the lesson plans developed by 29 pre-service
elementary teachers from a Korean university and assessing how they integrated
ChatGPT into science learning activities. We first examined how the subject
domains and teaching and learning methods/strategies were integrated with
ChatGPT in the lesson plans. We then evaluated the lesson plans using a
modified TPACK-based rubric. We further examined pre-service teachers'
perceptions and concerns about integrating ChatGPT into science learning.
Results show diverse applications of ChatGPT in different science domains.
Fourteen types of teaching and learning methods/strategies were identified in
the lesson plans. On average, the pre-service teachers' lesson plans scored
high on the modified TPACK-based rubric, indicating a reasonable envisage of
integrating ChatGPT into science learning, particularly in 'instructional
strategies & ChatGPT'. However, they scored relatively lower on exploiting
ChatGPT's functions toward its full potential compared to other aspects. The
study also identifies both appropriate and inappropriate use cases of ChatGPT
in lesson planning. Pre-service teachers anticipated ChatGPT to afford
high-quality questioning, self-directed learning, individualized learning
support, and formative assessment. Meanwhile, they also expressed concerns
about its accuracy and the risks that students may be overly dependent on
ChatGPT. They further suggested solutions to systemizing classroom dynamics
between teachers and students. The study underscores the need for more research
on the roles of generative AI in actual classroom settings and provides
insights for future AI-integrated science learning."	ArXiv

developers with coding and debugging tasks. However, their role in
collaborative issue resolution is underexplored. In this study, we analyzed
1,152 Developer-ChatGPT conversations across 1,012 issues in GitHub to examine
the diverse usage of ChatGPT and reliance on its generated code. Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we manually analyzed 289 conversations to
understand ChatGPT's usage in the GitHub Issues. Our analysis revealed that
ChatGPT is primarily utilized for ideation, whereas its usage for validation
(e.g., code documentation accuracy) is minimal. Second, we applied BERTopic
modeling to identify key areas of engagement on the entire dataset. We found
that backend issues (e.g., API management) dominate conversations, while
testing is surprisingly less covered. Third, we utilized the CPD clone
detection tool to check if the code generated by ChatGPT was used to address
issues. Our findings revealed that ChatGPT-generated code was used as-is to
resolve only 5.83\% of the issues. Fourth, we estimated sentiment using a
RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis model to determine developers' satisfaction
with different usages and engagement areas. We found positive sentiment (i.e.,
high satisfaction) about using ChatGPT for refactoring and addressing data
analytics (e.g., categorizing table data) issues. On the contrary, we observed
negative sentiment when using ChatGPT to debug issues and address automation
tasks (e.g., GUI interactions). Our findings show the unmet needs and growing
dissatisfaction among developers. Researchers and ChatGPT developers should
focus on developing task-specific solutions that help resolve diverse issues,
improving user satisfaction and problem-solving efficiency in software

suggesting that it is able to pass various professional and licensing
examinations. This suggests that ChatGPT may pass Turing Test in the near
future. However, a computer program that passing Turing Test can either mean
that it is a Chinese Room or artificially conscious. Hence, the question of
whether the current state of ChatGPT is more of a Chinese Room or approaching
artificial consciousness remains. Here, I demonstrate that the current version
of ChatGPT (Feb 13 version) is a Chinese Room. Despite potential evidence of
cognitive connections, ChatGPT exhibits critical errors in causal reasoning. At
the same time, I demonstrate that ChatGPT can generate all possible categorical
responses to the same question and response with erroneous examples; thus,
questioning its utility as a learning tool. I also show that ChatGPT is capable
of artificial hallucination, which is defined as generating confidently wrong
replies. It is likely that errors in causal reasoning leads to hallucinations.
More critically, ChatGPT generates false references to mimic real publications.
Therefore, its utility is cautioned."	ArXiv

the impressive emerging ability of ChatGPT in various NLP tasks, it is unclear
how well ChatGPT performs in causal reasoning. In this paper, we conduct the
first comprehensive evaluation of the ChatGPT's causal reasoning capabilities.
Experiments show that ChatGPT is not a good causal reasoner, but a good causal
explainer. Besides, ChatGPT has a serious hallucination on causal reasoning,
possibly due to the reporting biases between causal and non-causal
relationships in natural language, as well as ChatGPT's upgrading processes,
such as RLHF. The In-Context Learning (ICL) and Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
techniques can further exacerbate such causal hallucination. Additionally, the
causal reasoning ability of ChatGPT is sensitive to the words used to express
the causal concept in prompts, and close-ended prompts perform better than
open-ended prompts. For events in sentences, ChatGPT excels at capturing
explicit causality rather than implicit causality, and performs better in
sentences with lower event density and smaller lexical distance between events.

study juxtaposed the Chinese writing performance of ChatGPT and nine-year-old
children on both narrative and scientific topics, aiming to uncover the
relative strengths and weaknesses of ChatGPT in writing.
  The collected data were analyzed across five linguistic dimensions: fluency,
accuracy, complexity, cohesion, and emotion. Each dimension underwent
assessment through precise indices. The findings revealed that nine-year-old
children excelled beyond ChatGPT in terms of fluency and cohesion within their
writing. In contrast, ChatGPT manifested a superior performance in accuracy
compared to the children. Concerning complexity, children exhibited superior
skills in science-themed writing, while ChatGPT prevailed in nature-themed
writing. Significantly, this research is pioneering in revealing that
