This year alone I already spent $14k on my mental health care. Psychedelic sessions (it was worth it), Internal Family Systems therapy (for the present and the past), now NLP (for the present and the future). All of these out of pocket on payment plans because I never had good experiences with cheap therapists who take insurance, especially ones working in government-funded facilities. I burned through like 7 regular therapists last year and decided to go for the unconventional modalities and the type of therapists who don't take insurance at all. The type who can sit for multiple hours with you in one session to get really deep instead of ""whelp your hour is up, see you next week!"" just as you start unravelling and you need to check yourself for the next several days.

The NLP therapist/hypnotherapist I found via word of mouth cost $6k for a 6 month program package. It's a big financial commitment and I can't just fire her in the middle of the program if we're not a good fit. I hope it's worth it. Something I learned about therapy and mental health is treat it like plastic surgery - don't be cheap or try to save money, go for the best you can find. Trying to be cheap with therapy is like flying to Turkey for a botched nose job. I rather overpay for something that really works, rather than underpay for shitty service that does nothing - because the latter it's better off if you spent nothing at all.

My goal for next year, is that therapists have as topic shame to discuss with their clients, instead of asking them ""How was your week?"" Shame is the complex emotion that comes with feeling not acceptable and lovable for who we are and can have severe impact on our self perception, of what makes us feel acceptable and lovable. It can severly impacts our identity and confidence with the roles we fulfill in life, like at work and in private with friends, family and even when alone.

27	Is john Grinder New Code really NLP?	rotello	2024-11-14 15:51:00+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1gr7u4e/is_john_grinder_new_code_really_nlp/	"To those familiar with John Grinder’s work—particularly those who have studied with him directly or who have read *Whispering in the Wind* with appreciation—I have a question: can New Code truly be considered NLP?

I hold deep respect for Grinder’s contributions. His change formats are remarkable, both for their elegance and for their practical efficacy in coaching. However, the more I delve into various NLP texts, the less I see clear alignment with Grinder's approach. Grinder has distilled NLP to its core, eliminating what I might call the 'excess,' resulting in a methodology that feels distinct—perhaps even fundamentally different.

For some context, my journey with NLP began in the late '90s to early 2000s, when I immersed myself in early NLP works and admired Richard Bandler's unapologetic style. Though his seminars later in the 2000s left me disillusioned, I continued exploring the field through other authors, eventually growing disenchanted.

In the early 2010s, however, I discovered New Code NLP and came to recognize Grinder's mastery. I even pursued coaching, though, given the overall quality of coaches in Italy, I ultimately stepped back, working only with a few athletes each year. Discovering this subreddit initially rekindled my enthusiasm, yet after some reading, I found myself questioning again.

Reflecting further, I wonder if New Code truly belongs to the NLP lineage or if it merely shares a few core presuppositions."	Reddit

I am also suggesting to add our lineage, coz i guess it's pivotal in finding a definition.

My Lineage: studied Bandler stuff (maibly vhs and his students) in late 90 - end 00, then got certification in Grinder's school (early 10's - with Grinder & Frausin) and Pucelik (mid 10's - Pucelik & Frausin)

STEP 1: DEFINITION   
Grinder and Bostic St. Clair define Neuro-Linguistic Programming as ""the art and science of excellence,"" highlighting that it involves studying and replicating the strategies and behaviors of people who excel in various fields.

Modelling is thus the core of NLP, and the techniques are by products

STEP 2: WHAT TECNIQUES?  
This is something i would consider NLP - please forgive my jumping in logical levels:  


* Metamodel - Precision Language 
* Milton Model - Vague Language 
* Submodalities 
* Anchoring 
* Calibration 
* Perceptual positions  
* Time line 
* Grove model - Clean Language 
* Modelling (what kind of Modelling ?)  
* DHE

This is something i would not consider NLP coz it s not content free.

* Metaprograms 
* Ennagramm

66	The right way of doing modelling ... is not to do modelling	JoostvanderLeij	2024-10-21 07:41:27+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1g8k878/the_right_way_of_doing_modelling_is_not_to_do/	"Here is Richard Bandler's and my take on modelling:

1) Modelling is creating a mathematical model.

2) A model of X is the complete set of all relevant NLP strategies.

3) This means you must be able to do NLP strategies mathematically in the form of cybernetic transformations tables and the TOTE model.

4) Unfortunately, as it turns out a model is too rich. You risk copying submodalities sets that have negative unintended unconscuous consequences.

5) For that reason we stopped with modelling and instead turn to NLP strategy elicitation.

6) If a NLP strategy becomes really important we remove the specific submodalities setting from it to create a NLP technique. Hence modern day NLP primarily works with NLP techniques and nobody does any modelling, including NLP trainers like John Grinder who talk a lot about modelling. It is a lie.

7) Even NLP strategy elicitations is hardly ever done, because in the 54 years that NLP is on the planet most of the relevant strategies have been found.

8) Nevertheless, I have elicitated the following strategies for companies I worked for: a) strategy for social engineering, b) polyglot strategy, c) NLP magick. The first one is a trade secret, but I can share the second one if you DM me. The third one you can see here for a bit: [https://www.nlpmagick.net/](https://www.nlpmagick.net/)

9) Without the use of NLP I developed two major models: ABC-NLP which is a scientific grounded version of NLP. The Neurogram model for braintypes. See: [https://www.neurogram.nl/](https://www.neurogram.nl/)

10) Using real proper mathematical models I have created Bayesian network models for: personality typing, relationships, finding the right football players, predicting football matches, predicting the stock market.

How do I get NLP to work on me better?	MJamesM	2024-10-13 05:57:53+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1g2j3uo/i_have_a_hard_time_visualizing_things_in_my_own/	"As I learn more about NLP I find that I'm not really able to experience these concepts very vividly for myself. Although as I learn about NLP, I try things on people that are close to me, and I'm amazed at what happens. Things that I try on others seems to work to a certain degree, even though I don't really understand it and I still have a lot to learn.

On one specific occasion, she had negative feelings, she identified them as red and green. She had mentioned that there was a door at the front of her heart (whatever that means lol), so I used that in the process. I had her lay on her back, imagining holding a cup of hot coffee. As I rubbed my hand around her, I told her that it was hot as well. I had her imagine that all of this heat was making the red and green turn into steam inside of her. I told her steam rises and that the steam can rise out of the ""door at the front of her heart"" since she was laying on her back, so the door was up. She reported feeling relieved of the feelings as well as the colours. 

Even though I walked her through this process, trying to use her own creative visualisations in this process, I find that I'm not creative enough to come up with visualisations, or walk myself through any of this on my own.

79	The Wheat, the Chaff, and the Juggler	betlamed	2024-10-08 08:58:12+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1fyvbbw/the_wheat_the_chaff_and_the_juggler/	"I trained as an NLP practitioner in the 2000s. The certificate gathers dust somewhere. For a good while, I hated NLP. Now I kind of cautiously go back and explore some of it.

Let's say that about 5% of NLP actually works for me. Which is not a complaint - I think all communication methods are like that. There is no such thing as a generalized framework for great communication and self-development that works for everybody all the time.

To my surprise, when I recently gave a swish another try, it helped me get rid of a nasty habit that had been bugging me for 15 years. But whenever I tried the same thing in the past, it didn't work at all.

I don't think that I did it ""wrong"" back then. I rather think that all those methods only work in respect to the person and where they are in their lives. It's like a book that you didn't understand when you were young, and as you revisit it later, you discover meaning and fun without any effort, all by itself. And then some chapters just don't do it for you, and that is fine too.

Here is one crucial bit of evidence - and a great way to annoy coaches and youtube gurus: If you have discovered such a great tool for communication and personal development - why are you still making youtube videos and hanging out in dingy, dimly lit hotel conference rooms? Why are you not living the happy life in a palace?
Why did I have NLP trainers who were extremely overweight chain-smokers and obviously not very happy? Why did not a single person in my course solve at least one of their big life problems in over a year? Something is afish here.

There is no panacea. That's what.

Again, that is not to say that all those tools have no place. They are overgrown by the weeds of greed, promotion, self-aggrandizement, wishful thinking and marketing, and the pseudoscience and in-group lingo don't do much to help - but something useful grows under that layer of filth.

So one has to dig a bit deeper.

As for what works for me - I think it's not one particular pattern, one particular intervention, or even one ""sector"" of NLP (such as sleight of mouth). I won't ever put too much faith in eye access cues, and I certainly won't try to match anyone's decision strategy - but apart from those details, it's about attitude and style. Getting past the rigid patterns. Making stuff my own. Embodying states, moreso than desparately trying to ""work all sense modalities"". Mix and match, get creative. Not even trying to mirror, just being aware that it happens naturally anyway. Not trying to ""read eye access cues"" but just noticing that people do indeed move their eyes when they think hard. Not trying to ""do conversational hypnosis"", but accepting that language is always hypnotic, some styles moreso than others.

I'm a juggler, not an accountant.

What are your strategies for separating the wheat from the chaff? What are your red flags when it comes to coaches, gurus and organisations? What do you do to actively find out your favourite interventions?"	Reddit

I would get caught up in a spiral of negative thoughts that made it hard to get out of bed and pursue my goals. I felt like nothing mattered. But the truth is, it does matter. My thoughts were distorted, and I didn’t know how to regulate this side of myself. However, by using this technique, along with many other incredible methods, I’ve been able to overcome this distorted thinking. Now, I operate from a place of elevated emotions and focus on taking action towards my goals with clear intentions.

════════════════════════════

🪜HOW TO USE THE LADDER TECHNIQUE🪜

════════════════════════════

1. Write down the limiting thought and rate it from 0-5 based on how much you believe it to be true.
2. Write down the positive thought you desire and rate it from 0-5 based on how much you believe it to be true.
3. Then create a thought ladder of new positive thoughts that are more believable until you get to the desired thought and truly believe it to be true.

🪜Example of Thought Ladder🪜

* Current Thought: ""I'm not good at public speaking."" (4-5 belief)
* Goal Thought: ""I am a confident and effective public speaker."" (1-5 belief)

🪜Ladder Thoughts🪜

1. ""It's normal to feel nervous about public speaking.""
2. ""I have spoken in front of small groups successfully before.""
3. ""I can practice and improve my public speaking skills.""
4. ""I have prepared well and know my material.""
5. ""I am getting better at public speaking with each opportunity.""
6. ""People have told me I have a good speaking voice.""
7. ""I am feeling more confident in my public speaking abilities.""
8. ""I can captivate an audience with my words and ideas.""

════════════════════════════════════

Whenever you find yourself spiraling into a specific negative thought pattern, take a moment to write down your ‘thought ladder’ and then gradually repeat these new, elevated thoughts until they resonate as true within you. You only need to write them down once, as this process will help you memorize them. Remember, feeling is the secret. You must truly feel the emotions connected to the thoughts you are affirming. Don’t simply repeat them robotically; imbue them with genuine emotion, as this is key to making meaningful changes.

108	How powerful is NLP in its most current version? 	NightowlDE	2024-07-21 02:14:32+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1e8bt87/how_powerful_is_nlp_in_its_most_current_version/	"Allow me before defining this question more precisely, please, to elaborate on my motives to oppose the potential perception that I am only trying to take shots against NLP for my own amusement (which to be honest was my intention in coming to this sub but has since transformed into actual interest):

I first heard of NLP back when I was studying comparative linguistics from my then girlfriend who was much more interested in neurolinguistics than I was. My favorite part of the field was sociolinguistics in case you care to know. She described it to me as half cult half scam based on retracted works of Noam Chomsky and as her father was an acclaimed NLP instructor in her home town and beyond, I figured that she knowing more about neurolinguistics than me probably meant that she was right. Meeting her father also showed me that he did not have the argumentative power she had and which frankly were a reason I fell in love with her at the time. I was used to bring the most eloquent person in the room and to be the best versed in the art of verbal manipulation back then (amongst first school kids and then students) and people who could overpower me in an argument were absolutely special to me as I felt I could learn from them like normally I couldn't any further. Her father was also a vitalizingly challenging opponent to debate and charming about it too but he was nowhere her level of convincing.

So, my view on NLP was extremely biased. Today, many years later, I know that while she was absolutely convicing, she still also was wrong about some things. Mainly, she was an agnostic. Not an atheist. She believed that there were no higher power and that somehow imaginary constructs that billions of people attribute power over themselves to, that they still were nonexistent and definitely not bigger powers than a single human. She actually convinced me of that until we split but of course, it's absolute nonsense. There is a lot of unknowns about the powers standing over us but neither the power of imagination nor the power of faith are amongst those. We know both exist and play major roles in how the future of humanity unvolves. I should also have known this but she had an almost magical power when she spoke...

Around a decade aftet our split, I have been hit heavy bx fate more often than I can count and I learnt more than I imagined I ever could in a life time. Blessed be the power of simply allowing your universe to be expanded... I also overcame dogma in literal thousands of instances. I spent five years mentally moving deeply into the cognitive realms of witchcraft, occultism, etc to study and compare before returning a changed person with understanding beyond words. I have seen linguistic programming being used on the level of the whole anglosphere - but I somehow kept telling myself that NLP was not real based on really only my opinion that it isn't actually related to neurolinguistic but that instead all of NLP was psycholinguistics and that it was all faulty. I didn't even have an argument for the latter. It was clearly my mind being scared of the implications of there being real methods to (ignoring ethics here) to influence people's thoughts without them noticing. Today I see that protective mechanism and i know that pretending this can't work only protected a vulnerable spot in my psyche while acceptance of these basic facts has allowed me to get to where I would claim to at the very least have a fighting chance.

So, my question is: Where on the scale between ineffective scam and full mind control is NLP today?

I hope it's okay if I list a few features / milestones that I specifically wonder about:

As the name includes programming, do you also use modern algorithmics to bundle brainpower subconsciously? If so then how does NLP prevent identity lapovers within the users' consciousness?

Can you mentally communicate in clear text? I assume not but asking never hurts.

What is the level of automation and networking in NLP?

During consciousness takeovers, how do you safeguard the target's boundaries not being broken? I'm asking specifically because I am still struggling to detect with certainty at which point subconscious agreement ends and orders are executed only anymore based on automatisms and fears? I'm not saying that control over the latter doesn't have its right place too but I'm speaking more on the level of taking over someone's mind to calm them down when they're having a panic where you want to be minimally invasive for example. Or like when you work on a friend's psyche and you take their alpha status to push something beyond their boundaries. It's always a matter of additional communication that in a bigger application can't be guaranteed - or can it?

Is there any ethical binding involved in NLP? Like for example adhering to the 2021 rules of unity which many faith-based systems use to define a moral baseline. In other words: Can NLP be used to enable sexual and otherwise especially bad crimes or is it like a gun in that everyone best be armed to level the playing field?

Can you edit and delete memories in a target?

How far do you go with self-hypnosis?

Is NLP text only or does it also include visualization techniques and imaginary ritualism?

Can it be used without major trauma? (This might sound weird but some systems are encoded through specific trauma reactions one needs to experience in order to be able to learn using them. I assume it's not a trait of NLP but I want to be certain because I want no further trauma.)

How does the NLP community stand towards faith based neurolinguistic exploits like for example defining the communicated source of an information to match the characteristic of that God idea where God's ways don't make any sense to humans?

How far does ""NLP"" extend beyond linguistics? Are there storytelling techniques too, like establishing certain ideas while seemongly drifting off for only ever just a few sentence to later trigger a short break in conscious processing and anchor those earlier mentioned things as deep facts and from then on reference them to strengthen arguments?

I guess it all comes down to this:

Where does NLP set the boundaries?

I know that most of the things I mentioned can be achieved under certain conditions. I imagine that being true for fully verbal telepathic communication, too. It's likely just a matter of widening the bandwidth between the individuals to be able to send full text instead of emotional impulses. Regardless, many of these things come at very high prices (often involving traumatic experiences but by far not limited to that) and the rest usually is very challenging to people's imagination of what is possible and what isn't.

I understand of course that NLP is not a form of magick but rather a framework to improve communication - just, improvement can be many things based on perspective. Someone smart and rich might consider it a valuable improvement if something allows them to control those who are poor and just mildly intelligent or beyond that. Those on the other hand would not. So, what exactly is the ethical line of NLP?

Also: Is there any ""do no harm"" or ""only do as much harm as you truly have to"" rule? Or is just everything fair game maybe? I'm not judging, just asking!

And is there an anti-capitalist version of NLP or is it always gated with money?

I think that's more than enough questions for now. I thank you foe reading them all and I hope you find it in you to answer those you know the answer to. Thank you in advance.

Then there is a story about a shaman (with lots of background drums). I do not remember the story, but once when the story is over, he counts in reverse (I guess) and brings you back to the reality, here and now.

a weakened circulatory system due to covid has caused me to develop lightheadedness, brain fog, and instances of almost passing out.  
  
Because of this, when I would almost lose consciousness, I would have a panic attack and my heart-rate would shoot up. This probably helped me to not pass out, but it has probably caused another issue.

119	Reframing when there isn’t a negative voice, just a negative feeling	LittleRose83	2024-06-23 12:34:47+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1dml5hn/reframing_when_there_isnt_a_negative_voice_just_a/	"Hi everyone, I want to reframe a situation in my life to feel more positive and motivated about it and I tried using the steps in this video: https://youtu.be/cO8dt-vp9Go?si=muBDHmvbtVJkav5S

There is a part where the YouTuber says you might have a negative voice come up when you think about making positive changes in your life, and you should then ask yourself where that voice came from, perhaps it was a teacher or parent, and then you can replace it with a positive voice and/or vision.

I do have a negative voice come up but it's more of a negative and hopeless feeling, and I think I know where it comes from. As a kid my efforts and achievements were systematically ignored by my mother, so the more I took positive action, the more isolated I felt and this gave way to a generally helpless and hopeless feeling.

She might have given me a dirty look or said I did something wrong, but mostly she ignored my efforts, so any negative voice I think would be my own interpretation of things, thinking ""there's no point"", ""I'm not good enough"", ""I don't deserve good things / to take action for myself"", ""I'm not worth making the effort for"", I'm useless"" etc. but these thoughts are very much far out in the background, it's more of a vague, tired, hopeless feeling.

I would love to flip this feeling on its head somehow using NLP techniques, because sometimes I contemplate or begin taking positive action for myself and it can bring up feelings of it being pointless or that there will be negative consequences, which makes taking action harder than it needs to be. 

Does anyone have any ideas in terms of techniques or success stories involving a similar situation they've overcome and could share it here to help me?

But that's playing down green, up blue. Teenage years I had too much control of peers because, play dough. 20s decided to hop in passenger seat for a while to observe. Mid 20s found out that its a simple pattern of hot buttons until somebody told me that my social mechanisms were NLP. I had never heard of the concept and although I had operated the previous ways I felt a sort of moral corruption and had tried to swear it off prior and had absolutely retired certain mechanisms because I thought they were overpowered. But after being told I was using NLP and looking it up I felt morally bankrupt for doing so and have completely abstained from using any type of influence since. It's been a while since I would even communicate a perspective to another person because I started thinking it was so wrong even to point a person lost in a desert to a source of hydration. Should I return to the game?

168	How to remove ill anchors?	numeron7	2024-02-25 19:27:04+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1azwgfr/how_to_remove_ill_anchors/	"It's my first post in this reddit, so greetings to you all!

### The issue
In short, I am struggling with bladder (sphincter) spasms and urgent needs to urinate whenever I get a thought about anything related to peeing, when I do certain things, and when I reach certain locations.

Thinking about peeing makes me feel anxious.

""Do certain things"" - for example, getting up from my chair to take a break from coding.

""Several locations"" - for example, walking past the toilet or arriving home triggers bladder spasms and an urgent need to urinate.

The anchor is so bad that it also triggers subconsciously during the sleep which makes me wake up several times a night to pee. I became anxious to lie down to sleep because lying down in my bed evokes thoughts about peeing (it's a vicious circle).

My bladder is seriously struggling - it's trabeculated (thickened and lost elasticity). The many urologists I've seen cannot explain it because every test comes clean.

### What I tried
I've tried reanchoring thoughts using the canvas technique - but without success. Sometimes it would just aggravate the spasms.

I accepted the issue, worked through and ""released"" the many thoughts by letting them pass. It would feel great in the moment, but they just come back reinforced.

I did the NLP ""model exercise"", where I kept reinforcing the image of myself with an ""iron bladder"" and seeing myself as the best me.

I meditated regularly to keep my anxiety levels low.

I used warm packs to relax the bladder muscles.

I tried drinking low amounts of water - but I'd get triggers even while dehydrated.

I did belly massages.

I did bladder training.

### Other
To my understanding, this is the Pavlovian response. It triggers on thoughts and certain locations.

### What can I do?
If you know anything/anyone that could help me finally resolve this issue, please help. This agony is wrecking me...

179	Used NLP Submodalities to Wake Up from a Lucid Dream		2024-01-31 06:03:52+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/1afaxea/used_nlp_submodalities_to_wake_up_from_a_lucid/	"Recently, I had an experience that's been gnawing at my mind. One morning, after an early rise, I found myself catching some more Z's around 7 am. That's when things took a wild turn.

I slipped into a dream, but this wasn't your average dream. I was lucid - fully aware that I was in a dream state. I decided to bail on the dream, to wake up, check the time, the usual stuff.

But instead of waking up, my world plunged into darkness. I was conscious, but it was like I was trapped in this void, a complete abyss.

Before I could bug out, I remembered this technique from Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) known as submodalities. In the midst of this darkness, I visualized the words ""WAKE UP!"" in my mind. I tweaked the visualization, making it brighter, bigger, closer, clearer. Can't recall if I assigned it a color, but that's a minor detail.

And it worked. I woke up. Checked the time, everything was normal, and I returned to sleep. 

So, that's my story. But it got me thinking - what does this mean about the power of our minds? Can we control our dream states to this extent? And what about NLP - is this a common use of the technique, or did I stumble upon something new?

I'm curious to hear your thoughts. Has anyone else experienced something similar? What are your theories on what happened?"	Reddit

I communicate through text due to being nonverbal. Currently, I’m encountering communication barriers with my ESL builder during a major house renovation:

	1.	Decision-Making: Whenever I select an item, they point out issues. I propose an alternative, yet new problems arise, delaying the process.
	2.	Project Management: They express concerns about delays but initiated the work prematurely without ordering any of my selected items.
	3.	Interactions: At times, I perceive their attitude as patronising. My attempts to assert independence seem to irritate them.
	4.	Urgency and Response: They ask urgent questions, but their responses to my inquiries are tardy.
	5.	Message Clarity: Their messages often blend multiple points and questions, lacking punctuation and clear separation.

My understanding is stretched, and my brother is also exasperated by the builder’s approach. Despite dedicating a month to item selection, I was later constrained to choose only from local suppliers. I adapted, but the builder keeps altering requirements.

Flexibility on my part is becoming strenuous. For instance, after a two-day search for an alternative tile at their behest, they reverted to my original choice. This indecision is especially taxing given my hypersomnia; my energy is precious.

I’ve noticed brief responses are somewhat effective, yet not entirely resolving the issue. I’m considering more direct inquiries to elicit specific feedback, e.g., “Regarding this radiator, are there any specific concerns?”

Any insights or suggestions for simplifying our communication would be greatly appreciated.

187	Tips for navigating your internal experience		2024-01-09 22:40:15+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/192rz1b/tips_for_navigating_your_internal_experience/	"I've studied the works of Bandler, Steve Andreas, and many other prominent figures in the NLP community. I always believed most of NLP was bullshit and only scope / category or the meta-model were legitimate since you could rationalize them and actually change your mind about things. These models are just sets of analytical tools for your experience and how you make meaning. I could never really get submodality shifts to work for me, and never in any meaningful way. 

Last month, I started Igor Ledochowski's course on self hypnosis mostly out of curiosity and after the first few videos, I realized why submodalities and many NLP patterns never worked for me. (never mind the course itself, I just got something I might have gotten from a hypnosis book had I bothered to pick one up)

The first section was about managing and gathering your attention. Igor posits that you are not your mind (therefore not your behavior or beliefs) you are your attention. Attention == scopes that you're focused on. Attention at this level is always in first position, perceptual positions at lower levels are where NLP patterns happen. This seems obvious to anyone that has studied NLP. He gave us a couple of exercises on gathering attention, just looking around the room which involved actually looking at details of things then shifting your attention which reminded me of attention training technique in meta-cognitive therapy (I never practiced this for more than a month, and never in tandem with NLP).

The trick that pushed me over the edge and made things work for me was:

taking an experience, and asking myself questions that elicited content details starting from very obvious things (eyes closed here):  

- What color shirt am I wearing?
- What was directly in front of me?
- What do the backs of my hands look like?
etc.
- What does the separation between my sleeves and my hands look like?

After more and more details, I got a much better image of what I was trying to visualize and instead of a feeling of trying, I experienced a feeling of seeing. From there it becomes very easy to elicit the submodalities, and changing them really does give you emotional shifts! I never thought that focusing on details of the content itself would do anything for me.

The first exercise in the book Six Blind Elephants now makes a lot more sense (think of an unpleasant experience and list down the scopes in your experience as if you were going to ask your friend to direct a movie of your experience for you, then change scopes until the movie becomes pleasant).

The biggest result so far has been getting the rolemodel perceptual position pattern to work. It immediately makes me believe something is possible and passes ecology / congruence tests. I merely stepped into an experts body and made the statement ""It's possible for me to learn this"" without any resistance!

I hope this helps other noobies too!

tldr;

1. Collect your attention by looking at things around you. Notice the details and move on to the next object. Do this for like 2 minutes
2. Select any experience you've had and close your eyes
3. Ask yourself extremely basic questions about the experience, first eliciting visual content until you're satisfied with the detail of the experience
4. Elicit the process elements of the experience (submodalities)
5. Shift submodalities and see how doing that affects your experience"	Reddit

&#x200B;

**3 Mental Health Hacks Anyone can Use**

&#x200B;

As a former Mental Health Professional who specialized in helping Clients w/ Skills Training to Solve any/every Problem they may present w/, I Discovered, Shared, & Created more Life Hacks than I could ever recall, Helping the thousands of Clients I was fortunate enough to be able to Help even as I became too DisAbled to Work.  I both experienced & saw the tremendous amounts of Trauma that 2020’s COVID Created across the globe.  Realizing that every Human who Survives Childhood – let alone lived thru the entire COVID Pandemic – has at least been exposed to a potentially Traumatic Event, I have wanted to Create this short list since at least 2020, finally getting this out on New Year’s Eve going into 2024.

After my MH Career there weren’t many Hacks I’d not heard of in some form or another, so there is a specific Concept that when my current MH Counselor mentioned this to me it hit me like a ton of bricks (e.g., a Personal Epiphany like the other 2) & is something I keep coming back to, at least Daily.  Inspired by this, I wanted to present 2 of the best MH Hack Epiphanies I ever had, that I kept coming back to time & again to Help so very many Clients for so many Reasons.  I kept it short at a page-ish long, this very short list of the following **3 MH Hacks**.  In honor, I’ll start w/ the newest Hack I got from my own MH Counselor I’m fortunate enough to have Working w/ me, & work to the 2 Epiphanies I got a decade or more ago, to whit:

**#1** Practicing “**Mastery**” is the term that my current MH Counselor Inspired me w/, & is a very pro-MH Exercise – e.g., flushing the Cortisol, etc. from our Nervous/NeuroLogical System.  He defined it as, “a Durable Effectiveness in One’s Daily Life.”  I think the closest I came was suggesting to everyone that they engage w/ some sort of Activity they **Enjoy/inJoy,** or literally “**Bring Joy w/in**”, on the Daily, when particularly Stressed out to MAX, etc.  Whilst you may inJoy Gardening, Creating or engaging w/ Art or Music, Mechanical tinkering, Tai Chi or Yoga, Video Games, Cooking, or whatever else, the idea of “**Mastery**” broadens that out to include things like Cleaning, re-Organizing, &c.  I also stressed to my Clients how important ASC’s/Altered States of Consciousness can be – whether it be in Prayer, Meditation, Exercise, Singing, &c. – but particularly **FLOW States**, **States of Ecstasy**, & **Transcendence**.  Expressing Mastery often correlates w/ such ASC’s, and they all encourage Mental Health.  It’s encouraging to know that simply **Finishing** something (e.g., Cooking) can be 1 of countless super easy ways to Feel, Practice, & Express Mastery for one’s self.  It can help to Affirm such whilst engaging, e.g., “This is my Self-Care” if you wanna be Clinical about it, etc.

**#2** When I worked at the last Psychiatric Residential Treatment Facility a decade or so ago, I had a Weekly Meditation Class I taught.  It was only attended by 2 of the Residents, but as they were 2 of the Residents who struggled most w/ DisAbling MH Conditions, I felt it worth my Time & Energy to continue for the 2ish years I did.  During 1 particular Meditation Class, 1 of the Residents began to spike in MH Anxieties as she DeCompensated.  I had an Epiphany that I jokingly refer to as my “**Anti-Anxiety Meditation**” that I Shared w/ her then & that I’m honored to Share w/ you now:

Take **Slow**, **Calm**, **Deep** **Breaths**, focusing simply on the Breath and each of those 4 Words.  There are no “Rules” in Meditation, so feel free to Ignore or Change as you Will.  In the Experience of myself & others, it seems best to Focus on each Word w/ either an Inhalation or Exhalation.  If ***Anxiety*** requires our Breathing to become ***Rapid***, ***Tense***, & ***Shallow*** (and it does – try getting Anxious w/o them!), then Focusing on each Word w/ each Breath – not unlike a Mantra from the Eastern Traditions – can literally Hack your Nervous System from Experiencing Anxiety!  To Clarify, my Way is to begin on the Inhalation “**Slow**”ly, Exhaling “**Calm**”ly, Breathing in “**Deep**”ly, & finally Exhaling the word “**Breaths**” before returning to “Slow” on the next Inhalation, &c.  Don’t Stress or cause Tension as you do them – that’s what we’re trying to eliminate.  If you have other Distracting Thoughts, simply view them as a hazy Cloud that passes on by or fades away as you gently return to Slow, Calm, Deep, Breaths. You can do this anywhere you feel Anxiety, eyes open, even in a crowded subway!  Doing this for 30 seconds or more should yield immediate & notable Results.  To re-summarize:  
S**low** (inhale)

**Calm** (exhale)

**Deep** (inhale)

**Breaths** (exhale)

(repeat as needed)

&#x200B;

**#3** Here’s an early Epiphany I got when I was a teenager that Solved my being too much of a Worry Wart.  Re: ***Worrying*** about anything, it really just boils down to this simple Logic (CBT before I knew what CBT was LOL):

“If you can **Do** something, **Do** it.

If you can **Not** Do something, then **Don’t**.

There is **No** **Reason** to ‘***Worry****’*.”"	Reddit
193	Exercise: Creating a New Reality Tunnel (Map)	Red-Oak-Capital	2023-12-31 23:48:35+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/18vk9a8/exercise_creating_a_new_reality_tunnel_map/	"  **Highway Technique**

*The following is my creation, not sourced from a book, course, or class.*

**Acknowledgment:** \- Bandler & Grinder, 1979, *Frogs into Princes page 186, fourth paragraph* \- ""**And combining NLP and hypnosis is even more interesting.**""

For some, hurtful lingering preverbal imprinted memories, anchors, sensations, emotional auto-pilot reactions, and intrusive thought patterns defy standard therapy techniques. Be it perpetual anxiety, unending stress, CANT’T auditory tapes, distrust perceptions, or even a blurred sense of detached reality tranquility (*shock*) imprinted permanently while enduring prolonged rage belt beatings. 

One solution is to identify one or more desired daily autogenerated sensations, which will be created by a series of daily deep meditative trance states over time to slowly build and create an additional new Map of the world that incorporates pre-selected everyday habitual sensations coupled with the NLP timeline technique to reduce status quo anti-change defense mechanisms.

**Interested??????????**

**Step One**. While in a deep trance state, use the NLP timeline technique to visually perceive driving a car and then exiting onto a new mental highway. Imagine seeing the new exit sign in front of you, turning the steering wheel onto the exit, and finally driving on a brand-new section of highway. Look in the rearview mirror and see your old preverbal sensations (*old road representing your old Map*) behind you, slowly getting tinier and fading away (*disassociation*). Incorporate and combine additional preferred NLP techniques or modalities that assist in building and reinforcing this new reality tunnel. 

**Step Two**. While imagining driving on your new Reality Tunnel, turn on the car radio, which tells you that getting back on the old highway is possible should life situations dictate (*boundary setting, avoidance of abuse, call to action response, etc.*), which helps allow your current firewalls and Map to construction of an additional alternative grouping of new neurological wiring. In other words, develop a secondary Reality Tunnel (*Map*). 

While at a rest stop, meditate on allowing several reality tunnels to be seen on your Life Roadmap, which gives both the conscious and unconscious mind options to navigate and drive on either Map. 

(*Mental Navigation driving options*)

**Step Three.** Develop a personal mantra to associate with your new highway Map and repeat the mantra daily while in a deep trance. Imagine extending your new highway with each trance/mantra mediation session. 

**Example Highway Mantra**

**Breath:** **“**Joyous is the breath.” *Feel the air enter the nostrils, transcend down the throat, aerate the lungs, and expand the diaphragm.* *After a few weeks, normal breathing starts to self-generate, anchored low-level feelings of joy.* *3D block letters spelling out Joyous is an excellent, customized option, as is the background auditory message of “Joyous is the breath.”* Get creative and incorporate your favorite NLP techniques. Optional: Shorten to just one word, “Joyous.”

**Heart****:** **“***Wonderous is the beating heart**.”* (*Focus on one’s heartbeats.* *Eventually, individual sections of the heart will be felt separately.*)  (*Feel one’s muscles when exercising)*  

**Water****:** **“***Quenching is life-giving water**.”* (*Drinking cold water while repeating this mantra component intensifies the effect*.) Optional: Shorten to just one word, “Quenching.”

**Muscles:** **“**Rapturous muscle movement.” (*Demonstrative expression of spiritual energy*.) The combination of the visual three D letters of “Rapturous” and an auditory feed intensifies the neurological wiring of positive sensations. Optional: Shorten to just one word, “Rapturous.”

Silently repeat subcomponents of the mantra during everyday activities. I.e. “*Rapturous”* while lifting weights at the gym.

**Results**

This routine eventually generates habitual sensory responses throughout the day. While standard introspection therapies do wonders, occasionally, talk therapy fails to deliver relief. Since a new-mental-build concept does not rely upon any previous foundations, the mind can choose either imprinted Map. "	Reddit

I just can't handle my ""phobia"" anymore. I have zero knowledge about NLP, but maybe it could help with my problem. I'm extremely sensitive to noises.

I don't think that I have SSSS, because sounds of normal life are totally OK to me. I'm freaking out at nights, when I hear party noises, loud conversations, music and my worst enemy...bass. I can't focus on anything but fear of the noise (yes, i know how it sounds). It's totally crazy to me, because few years ago I had no problem with that. It started during pandemic, when my neighbors did extremely big party (lots of drunk people, shouting, police, etc.) Since then every sound at evening that could be connected to the beginning of the party (even louder lough) is driving me crazy. I can't think, work, watch TV or sleep. Every single night I'm afraid that this situation will repeat once again. I want to finally live my normal life.

For example:    **Territory and Pre-Human Instinct.**  In my opinion, the basic seeking out and guarding of environmental survival resources, which includes relationship ranking and tribal status, is very likely located in the PAG.  The periaqueductal gray, or PAG, is an area of gray matter found in the brain stem and midbrain and finally stretches out as communication extensions into our forebrain. The PAG surrounds the cerebral aqueduct (hence the name periaqueductal) and occupies a column of brainstem that stretches about 14 mm long.  The PAG can literally hijack conscious thoughts which then leads humans to do things such as declare war on other countries, enslave people, start mean girl games in High School, politically polarize countries, and endless variations of seeking out and preserving desired assets and social standing.

How to train the intuition?
Notice intuition is derived from 3 major directions – what you see, hear and feel.  So to train the intuition  , is to increase the use of these 3 major senses. Spend 30 mins each morning doing the following for 30 days:
1.	Visual – in 10 mins, observe quietly 10 people out in the open ie supermarket or shopping mall or coffee house.. check them out, watch their dressing, feel into them as they are speaking, see them move, speak and interact with other people.  See how they behave and see beyond their behaviour, their POSITIVE intentions. Then give ONLY a POSITIVE label to this person; eg: an valued organiser, a content creator, a superb interactor, a creative influencer… etc. whom you think they are.  


2.	Auditory – go to a park or mall.  For 10 mins, sit quietly close your eyes and listen… notice the sounds and voices of people or birds or any living thing.  Hear and notice how far they are, its volume, pitch, any distortions, try to identify what those voices, sounds or noises are - who or what kind of personality that person or living thing has.  And give it a positive label, eg: an inquisitive bird, a person in love, etc.


3.	Kinesthetic – take your phone record some conversations of people daily.  Go back home., in 10 mins listen to all the conversations.  Feel into the things and ways those people are speaking.  Feel into the words and tonalities and identify 5 types of feelings each person is going thro in the conversations.. eg happy, frustrations, anger, irritation, unsettled, unfair, calm, relax, exuberant…etc.
Do it daily only for 30 mins and if you are really earnest in doing it, you will see your intuition raise to very high levels."	Reddit
219	I think my friend may be using NLP against me	RedPandaParliament	2023-11-09 23:54:44+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/17rqthf/i_think_my_friend_may_be_using_nlp_against_me/	"A friend of mine whom I've known since we were 6 years old (we're now in our mid-30s), has been up front with me about he uses manipulation, NLP, even magick-al practices (that's a whole other story) in order to get what he wants in life. He's told me it's how he got and keeps his current partner. It's how he's gotten his college degree and jobs, etc.

I have wanted to think he wouldn't do the same to me, but I'm almost certain he is, and if that's true, I feel incredibly offended and taken advantage of.

I'm wondering if you in the subreddit can help me ascertain if some of these things are indeed NLP techniques; also, if they are, what are good methods to be strong against such techniques...and is it worth while to confront my friend about his use of these?

It's often such small and *seemingly* inocuous stuff. 

**Examples:**

He never asks me if I want to hang out...it's always something like ""We definitely need to hang out and talk about all this. You want to meet me at three, yes?""

He never uses question words like ""what, how, 'do you'"" etc... It's always a statement like what he wants me to assent to with a question mark. ""You'll call me after your done with work?""

The mirroring is intense, also. Even down to certain interests and such. Not long ago I took the MBTI personality test and he told me initially he was an INFP. After I told him I was an INFJ, he said he took the test again and 'Ope!' turns out he's an INFJ too. ""No wonder we're so similar, our brains are literally on the same wavelength, like we share each others thoughts and dreams."" he said.

He has told me before that he mainly uses magick through dream work. That he will project himself into my dreams.

Similar to the MBTI test, he also mirrored when I said I felt more like an introvert...previously he said he was an extravert and loved being with people. Now he says he's an introvert and prefers to stay at home and play music and read...curiously my main ways to relax as well.

Anyway, are any of those things, especially the way of phrasing questions and statements, and the mirroring, typical of NLP? And are there good ways to shield oneself against that?

Or do you think I'm just being a bit paranoid and looking into this too much?

I appreciate any thoughtful suggestions and analysis."	Reddit

For me, subtle sensations can now be fed and mixed into everyday life events.  Almost like selecting a background song without drowning out the real word sensations.   It seems somewhat distant and close at the same time. It could be meditational anchors without consciously creating an anchor.

How a person feeds one’s lower brain components or sub-modalities seems to greatly affect the efficacy of NLP techniques.  I think of providing my mind with raw data before the human filtering firewalls/filters, etc. From what I can gather, language is processed into what NLP authors describe as a digital feed, which makes sense. In other words, language is an excellent indication of essential human experience, but it is still not an original, very old brain data feed. Noam Chomsky's book ""On Language"" describes theories in depth.  Chomsky updated his theories by replacing Surface Structure with Phase Markers, which I took as a bit closer to pure human truth. I experimented with a few meditation exercises offering my subconscious hypnotic suggestions to imprint before my human firewalls. I could view modalities in what felt like pre-conversion to digital and pre-screening of filters. Meditatively came to me that humans probably have a fair amount of core instincts that would have been in place before humans developed the capacity of language. Chomsky wrote quite a bit about how humans eventually developed language ability. Whether real insight or just my imagination, I sensed starting to connect with some of the base original human instincts.  I now imagine just how vital it is to consciously select motivating images and auditory sayings all day, 365 days a year. "	Reddit

my wife is a hypnotherapy student and was having me go through an anchoring technique to create positive motivation around my daily journaling. everything was going well, I was visualizing something that I love to do, I could feel the elevated positive emotions, it was great. then after that visualization, she had me take 3 deep breaths. as I began to take those deep breaths, I felt a heavy blanket of sadness come over me. it was so strong that I couldn't speak. I started crying uncontrollably and had to stop the exercise.  


we thought that maybe I had chosen the wrong thing to focus on to create positive emotions, so we tried again with a different topic. again the visualization of the positive experience was vivid, I was feeling great. then it was time to breathe. again, after the 3rd breath, I couldn't speak, the left side of my throat started hurting, and I started to cry.  we had to stop.  


it's hard for me to fully explain the feeling, but it felt deep, sad, similar to grief, but I didn't have anyone in my mind to grieve. the feeling completely took over my body and everything else was shut out.

Contrary to popular belief, personality traits are not locked in by 1st grade. While most individuals’ personalities remain the same, change is possible. In 350 BC, Aristotle taught his students that virtuous traits such as bravery are obtained via the repetition of brave acts. Re-Mixing Traumatic Memories exercises focus on harnessing intense hurtful memories and re-fashioning them into lasting energized structural personality changes. (*Also called Memory Re-Consolidation in the field of neuroscience*) For example, old hurts can be transformed into a personality that bonds, loves, and protects like a pit bull or whatever selected personality traits are chosen. ***Intrigued?*** If so, the following motivational and emotional modification tool may be what you seek. 

**Associated Information** \- From Frogs into Princes 1979 - page 186, fourth paragraph - ""**And combining NLP and hypnosis is even more interesting.**""

**Why mixing works****:** After a recalled memory is vividly re-experienced, the human mind re-saves the images, which usually slightly alters the memory. The key to emotional re-mixing is introducing new information while memory plays. Reflective pondering or discussion long after the brain hi-jack has occurred may provide intellectual insights. Still, a future-triggered memory will replay with the exact modalities and intensities despite newly learned intellectual insights. The stored memory has a start button like a short video clip and is not directly connected to intellectual insight knowledge. Techniques such as timeline visualization of putting troubling memories behind yourself work because the mind tones down the associated emotional response. Dissociation techniques are beneficial, and a head-on tool for harnessing the intensity of disturbing recalled memories by imprinting new additional information that can drastically alter emotional responses and core beliefs to obtain empowering positive outcomes. 

**Re-Framing and Emotionally Re-Mixing Images like a DJ Exercise**

**Step One.** While calm and in a creative state of mind, brainstorm and think of various empowering additive counterwords to bind with current triggers or past troubling traumas.  *Counterword examples**:*  “Remaining Determined,” ""*Brave,"" ""Alpha,"" ""Loving,"" ""Empowering,*"" “*Relentless*,” “*Confident*”, *etc*.  *Problematic Example*: Fear of Public Speaking. *Counter word:* *“Energizing”.* 

**Step Two.** Envision your empowering counterword by itself in 3D block letters.  I prefer white letters with thin black lines, but any color will do.  A block letter with imagined sides seems more potent than standard print letters, but both typesets imprint on the subconscious mind.  

**Step Three.**  Relax into a calm trance state.  Trance induction usually only happens in perceived safe places, so please find a safe setting that works for you. Even deeper states of trance and stronger counter subconscious imprinting in settings such as a sauna, hot bath, hot tub, quiet forest, or quiet beach setting. Vacations provide new settings for more profound and more powerful imprinting.  *i.e., sunrise on a beach.* 

**Step Four.**  Carefully remember the problematic example or traumatic memory and quickly visualize the empowering 3-D counter letters in the top center of the image while the memory is replayed.  Also, imagine the 3-D counter words as if they are in front of the picture. As if looking into a room and seeing the counter words first.  Placing the letters at the beginning of the small video-type clip speaks powerfully to the subconscious and alters the emotion associated with the traumatic recall.  *Notation**:* *For some, visualizing and hearing the counter word imprints more effectively on one’s in-breath or out-breath.* 

**Step Five.**  If possible, add the counterword auditorily while visualizing. I.e., ""Loved"" while the 3-D letters are being visualized.  

**Step Six.**  Focus on incorporating the associated counter-word kinesthetic sensation.  I.e., trigger a remembered trauma and imprint a past sensation of a loving moment meant to help your subconscious respond differently to past cues and triggers.  

**Step Seven.** Imagine the 3-D counter letters expanding in size to tell your lower brain feeling components that you are growing emotionally in a positive direction. 

**Step Eight.** Imagine powerful feelings such as being loved upon feeding into the mix. I feel the most effect of the sensation of a positive emotion entering from my left side of the frame.

**Step Nine.** Use an enjoyable song that seems somehow associated with the fill-in-the-blank issue and let it become background audio like in the movies. Sometimes, music can magnify the emotional re-consolidation process.

**Step Ten.** **Recall the newly** **Re-Mixed Memory when triggered or approaching a stressful situation****.** I hope this is helpful.  😊"	Reddit

An affect approach is closer to the final truth.   Much of his theory surrounds lower-brain learning and integration into upper-brain cognition.  NLP feeds lower-brain regions either enrichment or corrective images, for starters.  Now that I have a deeper understanding of cognition, I seem to be much better at picking and selecting emotions that dovetail with goals.  Pankseepp does not use the words ""NLP"", but gives NLP a bullseye rating and suggests to his colleagues that Memory Reconstruction be incorporated into mainstream therapies.   Pretty neat reading to experience that type of validation for NLP.  "	Reddit

John Grinder is a bullshit artist. His 5 steps of modelling are pure BS and I applaud John Grinder for being able to sell it to people.

1) Find a genius. (but everyone is a genius so you can just speak to anyone. It completely does away with the concept of genius).

2) Unconsciously assimilate patterning. Hahaha, what complete BS. This is a magick sauce recipe. No-one has any clue how to do this. If you achieve anything the reason is this magick recipe and if you fail well then it is your fault for not following the recipe.

3) Practice in parallel context. Well nobody is against practice. Given that step (2) is complete bullshit. So far we have: find anyone who is good at something and practice what they are doing. Brilliant! Haha, you have just been sold to imitate someone. And that is it. This is by the way they whole course.

4) Conscious / unconscious dance in order to find a way of coding. Haha, even more bullshit is being sold. Another magick recipe where you are at fault if it fails because nobody knows what this means and it could mean anything. As you just demonstrated.

5) Testing. Ah, it makes sense again.

So basically John Grinder is selling you and extremely simple strategy:

1) imitate someone 2) test whether it works. 3) if not try again. Basically the TOTE model. You have been duped by John Grinder and find it hard to come to reality with that."	Reddit

Emotional blackmail via elimination of contact was the response after multi-family members set boundaries.   The emotional problem is the natural sense of relationship loss.  I decided that feeling a sense of loss repetitively did not make sense because that would possibly nominalize the feeling by making it unending which is what I call a time distortion.    Still, Furthermore, none of the family members who said no to a money grab were given a choice to remain emotionally connected.   The lure of a large amount of money started competitive greed which usually destroys relationships.  That realization led me to start focusing on two future-paced outcomes instead of a sense of relationship loss.  **Is this reframing?**  	Reddit

* Taming the DMN (forgot the website it's from). Describes how to shut off the part of the brain responsible for creating mind-chatter (Default Mode Network) through external sensory awareness, 
* Michael Breen's free webinar on the monkey mind and Mindfulness which he talks about DMN and ""mental tasking"" but doesn't provide a clear instructions or criteria for formulating proper ""mental tasks"".
* Igor's ""Beyond Self-hypnosis"" is a great course on meditation (introspection), on accessing a deep meditative state, which can help with astral projection and lucid dreaming. But is not intended nor covers the topic I mentioned. Plus, I am looking for a NLP model of these abilities which is more overt installation than covert/hypnosis installation. 

I am asking because I am currently modeling these subjects and experimenting with different protocols myself. I have a basic theory for these phenomena and general outline for cultivating these abilities. So I'm curious to see if there's any other works on these subjects from an NLP perspective to compare my ideas to and see if they have something different. Thanks in advance for the replies. "	Reddit

FYI, Narcissist doesn't have empathy for other's inconvenience. They want to get whatever they want at the cost of everyone else. They don’t do reasoning nor self-reflection.

I have told ""we are not good match. You should find someone else"" to one of the Narcists and she retaliated by refusing to pay for the services already rendered and 1-star google review. They always retaliate one way or another when I set up boundary.

I want to find a technique to say ""no"" to narcissists without (especially) being upset myself nor being retaliated. Telling them, ""I will answer questions when you come see me"", or even fire the Narcists as patients without upsetting them. Phrasing in a way as if stop seeing me is their benefit, appealing to their sense of superiority and need for admiration.

The power dynamic has shifted to their side. 

However, if you accept the offer, but tweak it as per your preference, then you shift the power dynamic in your favour and you will always win. For example, if you are offered tea or coffee, and you reply with, “yes coffee, but make it black”, now the power dynamic is in your favour. But if you say, “no thanks”, then you have given power over to the other side. 

What do you think about it?

I personally feel that this concept is stupid. If I refuse the offer because I know that I don’t want a beverage, then it still keeps the power dynamic in my favour, because it shows that I will not just accept anything you offer, I know what I want and what I don’t want.

I'm wondering if using a associating technique where say you have something be a trigger in waking state and have that trigger play automatically and randomly one time durning sleeping so you would do that program unconsciously.

Say for example, you have a essential oil diffuser that has a built in timer and durning the day you program that smell to trigger you to think/ visualize a certain way in regards to LD/ AP. Then when you go to sleep and time passes, the oil diffuser goes off according to the time and hour you set it on and unconsciously you smell that scent and subconsciously you ""run your built in program"". Which triggers you during sleep/ the dream to realize that you're dreaming according to what you did to associate that scent.

I feel like this image held significance and I’ve been obsessing if something is wrong with my imagery. 

I was on a bus at the time with 2 hours sleep and very stressed for context

I'm interested in signing up for Richard Bandler's NLP-Eternal. I would like to alternate between his later stuff (which I'm told is better in the sense that he's further developed his techniques and refined his teaching approach) and his older stuff (which I'm told is better in the sense that he is often more explicit in describing things).

So my question is how to prioritize what I learn first and integrate. I can see this being a long-term learning project because there are over 35 seminars listed alone, so watching it and actually practicing it all will take some time and energy. I think it's worth it because repetition further ingrains things, and each seminar is going to be a bit different. But I'm not quite sure where to start or what would be a logical order to go through that content.

So any suggestions for creating a rubric for myself? I'd love any insights any of you might have, either from having gone through NLP Eternal itself, or from your experiences with Richard or his material."	Reddit

I dont know exactly how it started but certainly around 9 years old onwards. I head aunts who are very appearance conscious and did not like the way they looked in photographs. They would cut their photographs out of group photos if they did not like them. I also went through an incredibly ugly duckling phase and was not included in many group photographs. But I can't be sure what the exact root cause is.

It is an issue from a practical perspective - eg photo ID, passport, work entry cards but also on a personal level it is an issue as I dont really have any memories.

I cannot join in social media and I also think when nasty people find out about my dislike of being photographed they bully me and deliberately try and take photos of me in unflattering angles, which does not help me one bit, if anything makes my plight worse.

I have looked into several practitioners who say they think they can help me but then cover themselves with results aren't guaranteed etc. I'm looking at putting up almost £1000 for the course of sessions, so can't really make the gamble!

I wonder if any of your experience you've had success with this specific fear and if so which technique did you use or any technique that you would recommend.

I did try my favourite technique which is the phobia cure, but it's not really a phobia. It's more a fear, an uncomfortability, an inability to relax when in front of a camera or if someone is photographing me."	Reddit

When I got intrusive imagery once, I could see the image in my mind but it felt as if it was right in front of me. Even though I was consumed by it, I could still see the room I was in.

332	Effective Body Language Mirroring	AppliedPsychSubstack	2023-05-14 18:44:14+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/13hjwkc/effective_body_language_mirroring/	"Mirroring is the first hypnotic skill everyone should know.

It’s incredibly easy, teaches important habits, and it is sufficient to induce sleeping trance. If you aren’t getting amazing results, you aren’t doing it right.

Before I knew what mirroring was, I remember being at home on a video call with my parents and noticing they had the same laugh. They would start laughing at the same time, their eyes would crinkle in the same way, and when they finished laughing they would both relax and breathe out in the exact same way.

After we logged off for the night, I started to wonder if this was part of the reason old couples look so similar. Not only do they eat the same food and share the same environment for decades, but they also start to share the same expressions and mannerisms.

I pulled up Google Chrome to do some research and I learned a few things:

People match body language unconsciously all the time- to signal friendship, comfort, and alignment. If you’re excited, I’m excited. If you’re incredibly happy, then I’m incredibly happy with you and for you. Or if you’re hated, if you’re not accepted, then I’m just as much of an outcast as you are.

It’s a deep and tribal feeling that might be called *connection* or *rapport*. It’s a real feeling that people really enjoy.

I also learned that the principle of treating your acquaintances like your friends applies here as well. If you mirror with people that you’ve just met, you’ll begin to feel connected in ways that you never have before.

After I learned all this, I started to try mirroring in the real world, and I learned things that weren’t online so I could bring them back to you.

\---

The goal when mirroring is to come into perfect sync. You move when they move, with the same duration and speed and in a way that’s complementary to their movement.

If they pull something to themselves, you pull something to yourself, with the same speed, start and end.

Mimicking static body language like someone’s posture is effective, but coming into full dynamic sync is incredibly powerful and represents the pinnacle of mirroring. You can attain this by learning the signs of when someone is about to move, and practicing regularly.

Use your peripheral vision. Most of the large body language movements will be visible without you staring directly at them, so just notice them in your periphery and adjust accordingly.

When you arrive somewhere, arrive in the body language of the person you’re mirroring. If they’re sitting in a relaxed manner, don’t sit and then mirror, make it all one movement and sit directly as they are. This works especially well for making a first impression.

On natural movement in general, you’ll have to use your best judgment. If someone is using energetic hand gestures as they speak, don’t repeat those as they’re talking, but if you’re talking about something with a similar energy later, then do the same sorts of gestures. Beyond best judgment, you’ll need a dancer’s sense of movement. Move smoothly, don’t compensate for mistakes, and just relax.

Above all else, have the other person’s best interest at heart. You’ll naturally feel more connected with them by the mirroring, so allow yourself to feel that strongly and enjoy interacting with another human being with a whole vibrant inner world just like your own.

\---

After I really started to develop my understanding of mirroring I had a new power to affect people around me. People listen to people they like, and they took my words more seriously. If you want the power of influence and you’ll use it for the good of the people around you, consider following me on [Substack](https://appliedpsych.substack.com/) or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AppliedPsych101) and I can teach you more.

Or if you’re not sure about the effectiveness of mirroring, go out and try it. Don’t try it once, try it until it works, and when it does, come back and find more things to try."	Reddit

I seem to be having a very hard time visualizing new and creative ideas.

Recently I tried to design the backyard garden and could not visualize it.   I could get the ""feel"" of the desired garden -  flows, peaceful, birds, green, sunlight - but not the actual visualization (which trees go where for a balanced design and privacy screen).  Repeated attempts have not helped.

This is concerning as I used to be better at this and have always been a creative type.  Am wondering if scrolling through Google, watching TV,  scrolling through the phone the last few years is making me a passive rather than an active thinker.  i.e. Looking at garden designs vs imagining garden designs. 

I'm almost always stuck in ""subvocalization"" mode - internal dialogue.  It's been nearly impossible to get past that when reading and come up with a visualization.   Same when listening.  Also struggle with visual memory esp. when drawing.

Hoping there are some NLP techniques that can help shut down the subvocalization and get me into visual mode.   (internal and external).Thank you"	Reddit

Edit: A lot of you guys actually don't get it well...

I  am reading (again) the two volumes of the structure of magic. I'm not  posting this comment because i saw a random video or post that said that  NLP is pseudocience. (the wikipedia source cliché).

I  have a lot of experience reading bs (thanks to my mom and my grandpa). I  recently found a book about NLP that my grandpa had, that's how i  started to do my research about it and within a few days i understood  why is a pseudocience.

And  actually i'm making an article about it with sources and everything in  order. (BUT, let me finish it then say whatever you want.)

It's  funny how after NLP was found not to be as effective as it was  proclaimed, the bad arguments started to raise within it's community.  Instead of accepting that the meta-model was wrong.

And  i'm basing my affirmation with the definition of pseudocience by Mario  Bunge and how the new redefinitions of NLP contradict the original model  made by it's creators (what i call ""unsolved contradictions"") and how  the lack of neurological explanations make the metamodel ""incompetent""  to be a source of solutions (Still don't know how autism enters NLP).

He says he can be having a good day, out and about running errands. But if he “senses” that somebody gave him a dirty/angry look, was not friendly or ignored him it triggers him with feeling of Anger and Fear. He says a public confrontation is like his worst nightmare. 

He says that even a facial expression from somebody can trigger the anger and fear, no thoughts are involved just the trigger and instant physical reaction. He says he feels it mainly in his chest and throat. 

Consciously he knows it’s silly and would rather laugh it off and ignore it but he feels his subconscious just takes over. 

The reasons i say he “senses” is because most of the time the people aren’t even angry or dislike him. He says their have been times he would get angry and fearful from somebody he “thought” didn’t like him or was angry with him. And that once he talked to them they turned out to be friendly…..he says that the anger and fear he was feeling instantly disappears when he realizes it was all in his head. 

He says if this happens with his brother or mother the feeling are even worse. But with his father or sister he is way calmer and doesn’t get those feeling if there is an argument. 

He was also bullied as a kid. He says he constantly thinks negative and is always looking for dangers. 

Any suggestions?!?!

390	How does time relate to loops?	Technical_Captain_15	2022-12-13 15:25:55+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/zkydln/how_does_time_relate_to_loops/	"I just learned last night about open loops, closed loops, and loops within loops.  


I was wondering what sort of factor time plays into loops with regard to satisfaction and dissatisfaction.  


What I mean is, is there a relationship between how long it takes to close a loop and the amount of satisfaction one receives when it is closed? Whether it be the longer you take the more satisfaction one receives or perhaps the amount of time is too long and the person starts to care less and that satisfaction would start to wane the longer it takes to close the loop.  


Or maybe this is just too context dependent to give a straight answer?  


I would appreciate any feedback. Also if anyone has a resource, book or lecture, where I can learn about this aspect specifically or just about loops in general. I'm still very much brand new to the NLP world.

I have been reading a few NLP books over the last few weeks and decided I want to learn this more in depth.

The best thing would be for me to go to a live seminar but because I'm traveling a lot, this won't be possible for the next few years.

For the time being I figured it would be best to learn from videos and books.

It's my hunch that in the beginning it's best to stick to one teacher to get solid on the foundations and then later on explore different teachers.

The name that comes to mind is Richard Bandler because he seems to have been around the longest and has a lot of materials available.

I'm very serious about learning NLP and I'm trying to build a little roadmap for myself to get a solid foundation and to know what to learn next.

Could someone point me in the right direction as which programs would be best to start out with and where to go from there?

Thank you :)

I realize that's a bit vague and they weren't able to really quantify that much.  


While I've learned quite a bit of NLP and trained with several hypnotists and NLP trainers, I have never actually trained with Bandler. A lot of my trainers have trained with Bandler, but not necessarily exclusively or intensively so far as I know. What I am wondering is if there's anything he does that's unique or that seems to be particularly effective. In practice, how would that old-school Bandler compare to his new stuff or John Grinder's New Code, or any other prominent NLPers?

  
I know he focuses on unconscious installation rather than more overt/conscious installation of techniques. Can anybody speak to that?

  
The other thing I am hearing is his older stuff seems to be better and that some of what he used to teach that was allegedly more effective may not be taught anymore. Obviously most people would want ""the good stuff"" or the secret techniques. I like to not buy into hype, but is there any validity to that? If so, is there anywhere to find/learn the old stuff (books, videos, trainers carrying on the tradition, etc.)?"	Reddit

I'm new to all of NLP's techniques and I still trying to put them into practice. One of them, Swish Pattern, gave me some doubts. 

When I read about it in a book, it basically stated that the image of the habit, experience, etc that you want to get rid of must be visualized in an associate state. On the contrary, the goal or experience you want to achieve must be visualized in a dissociated state.

The problem is that after reading more about associate and dissociated states from other books, I learned association relates to more positive results, making an event or experience more powerful. Instead, dissociation is related with make less powerful and painful an experience.

So what is the trick or the exemption with this technique?  It seems more logical to use dissociate sight for the image you want to get rid of and associate sight with the one you want.

Btw, the from I learned this technique is Unlimited Power by Tony Robbins.

484	NLP technique to stop cheating on his partner?	NothingnessOne	2022-04-27 01:03:41+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/ucrkmo/nlp_technique_to_stop_cheating_on_his_partner/	"I'm coaching someone (my 1st time, I'm not charging him he asked me to practice on him to see if it helped when I said I started learning) who says he feels compelled to cheat no matter how hard he tries to give up for good he ends up returning to this behaviour. I've only used a few NLP techniques before (haven't learnt anything properly yet) but thought it would fit such addictive behaviour? I also use hypnosis but he says it hasn't helped him so far.

I discussed it with him even though he was uncomfortable. He said his partner has low sex drive and it's also painful for her so he moved to pornography/masturbation which didn't meet his needs, he said it increased his drive and then he started becoming tempted by women in the workplace etc until he started having an affair, that increased it even more until he started having multiple sex partners at once. He says he loves his partner and would never want her to be hurt by his actions so he wants to stop, he can't find an alternative solution which can cater for his high sex drive apart from leaving the relationship (she wouldn't agree to an open relationship) but he can't bring himself to leave her, saying it's purely a physical need, and once he's done the actual act he only feels remorse, it's not exciting or enjoyable for him.

He definitely has low self esteem and I think he's seeking validation. When I pointed this out he said he does get emotional validation from other family members, and that it's a biological problem.  He says his partner does meet his emotional needs  most of the time. When asked if his partner were to entertain an open relationship, he said regardless of the guilt he experienced (and what his partner thought) he believed it was totally wrong morally and just wanted to be given a technique to help him kickstart change as he's been trying to change from the first time it happened. He's had long periods in between where he's managed to stay away from all temptation.

TL;DR:

An NLP master got a friend to feel nausea at the smell of fried chicken (she doubted NLP and he asked what do you wish to change, she said she's addicted to it). She was asked to recall a time she felt strong nausea. So he created an association so strong that she felt it when she smelt chicken, was this the Pavlov effect and how was he able to do it with immediate effect? I think it was an anchoring/associating technique maybe, she said it lasted 3 months So I was curious to find out more about the technique? (This is the main point of my question)."	Reddit

Read an article talking about how you can tell when someone is lying based on the direction their eyes are looking. Looking up to the left when thinking or talking signifies constructing new images never seen before and this means you are ""lying"". This is just not true. I've been watching a lot of chess players for instance and its common that while they are playing and they think before a move to calculate they look up to the left. They are in fact ""constructing a new image"" in their mind by analyzing the position of the board and calculating possible moves for what might transpire and where they need to move their pieces. This has nothing to do with ""lying"". The ability to construct new images in the mind has nothing to do with deceit, maybe it could, but it has more to do with problem solving, imagination, and creativity. Just wanted to share this for people who think they can ""catch others when they are lying"" to help them consider that they are deceiving themselves."	Reddit

In an unrelated situation lol we (my wife and I and her sibs) are attempting to convince her Mom to get psychiatric treatment.  A sort of intervention. I crafted a loving letter from us all identifying a single point of focus, her unintentional untrustworthiness, that has spanned decades and is present in almost every interaction she has.  She is cash-register honest but has some really repetitive coping mechanisms that manifest in manipulation. 
We asked her to proceed with a psychiatric evaluation and ongoing treatment. After a few days she replied.  Her reply was in a doc, in red,  italicized font and was loaded with kinesthetic and visual markers. But I'm a bit too novice NLP to really handle all this surface structure.

Here's what I did. I went to a site on NLP, and looked at their page on weight loss. They had a few techniques as well as some common sense advice like eating only at certain times of day. They covered anchoring and,if I remember right, time line work.

I have schizophrenia, and I take medicine that makes it way too easy to gain weight and hard to lose it. I thought about my previous strategy for losing weight, which worked to get me from around 290 to about 275. I thought about that strategy. Then, I went into the future on my timeline and saw myself at 200. I took the feelings from there and went back to a few still future steps, seeing how my previous strategy worked for me. I took from there feelings of self control, and changed my feeling of hunger in the middle of the night to being satisfied by water and celery. I then brought all that back to the present. On days when I have trouble, I don't eat nearly as much as I used to, and the celery and water are becoming more of a craving for me at night.

That's my feel good about myself part. Here's the next part: can anyone tell me any ways I can get even better results, or improve on what I did?"	Reddit

I had my first experiences with NLP, per se, in 1991, although my interest in hypnosis dated back to decades before that.  I was fortunate: Robert McDonald took me as a personal client to help me get through some incongruities.  I had read a book on the subject, probably ""Frogs into Princes"".  Still, I didn't really know what to expect.   I walked in to see him, he asked me to sit down...and within a few minutes my arms were floating around in the air, independent of me and each other, and I was seeing, and mediating with, a blue circle and a red square as they floated around the room.  That first two or three hours culminated in a visual squash, with two strongly polarized aspects of me, which had been fighting for a long time  (the analytic and considerably scientifically educated part of me, and the part which wrote poetry and believed in ""magic"")  pulling forcibly together and reconciling to appreciate each other and work together.  In the ensuing days, EVERYTHING started to change in my life as my hair, which had been falling out leaving a roving bald spot, grew back and I began to change priorities in life.  I attended a 27-day practitioner training intensive with Connie Rae, in a remote area of Colorado, a few months later.   I went on to attend many other trainings, in NLP and hypnosis, and even some in more independent realms, including alchemical hypnosis certification and Gendlin's Focusing/felt-sense work.  It's been a long, strange, rewarding ride.

I'm posting here today because I am hoping to rekindle the ""magic"" for myself and double down on taking personal responsibility for continuing to evolve and to integrate.   I think a lot of idealism and ""magic"" has disappeared from the larger NLP community in the ensuing decades, but perhaps that is just me.   I think Bandler noted:  ""When rats find something that works, they keep doing it.  When humans find something that works, they want something new and different!""  That is kind of a weird thing about humans.

As part of my New Years's Outcomes, I resolved to devote more focussed attention to improving my NLP and, especially, my application of NLP and other indirect communication best-practices, with both my inner-realms and my outer.  Years ago, I had reliable finger signals and I could do a lot of work with myself by just relaxing and going into trance.    Somewhere along the way, I lost that.

Then, last night I sat down and tried, again, to get in touch with some part of me willing to take ownership of a difficult aspect of my life, acknowledging that I can't do it consciously.   I sincerely wanted help to weave my future back together after all the disappointments and Covid lock-downs.

Something happened!  I started getting involuntary finger twitches on my left hand, as a part of me volunteered for the job.    Then I asked for any other parts which might be willing to assist... and my right hand came alive as a first one finger and then another and then another began to bob and weave and a torrent of unconscious communication pulled me deep into trance.  I feel so wonderful this morning; so grateful.   And there is that ""felt sense"" again that I am not alone and I can relax and just trust the process of change. At least I am finally sure I am up for the momentous challenges of the new year as I, once again, start to reinvent myself.

Hopefully, that is okay as an introduction?   I know NLP training, and related things which require live community, have taken a hit due to Covid lockdowns and the government fomenting of hysteria and othering.  I never thought I would live to personally participate in a mass hypnosis event like Nazi Germany or the Salem Witch Hunts.   But here we are!

I would appreciate any leads, anyone might offer, to great NLP or hypnosis training or trainers who are still willing to meet in person, ideally in some sort of intensive environment.   I really want to do a lot more generative work, evolving myself and learning new skills.   I think strong, positive, community energy like used to exist in the earlier days of NLP (before commercialism and ""Never Lower Prices"" became the primary thing)  would be really nice to find.  Or rekindle.

A lot of people, I expect, have never really encountered The Structure of Magic.  That takes a really bright spirit, a shaman of sorts, to meld together art and science."	Reddit

A phrase marketed as a ""taboo"" to make all opinions respectable and valuable

This would make opinions of real value ordinary and relative opinions

It is the modern way to resist and withdraw the legitimacy, power and prestige of truly valuable opinions

A very effective way to market unvalued opinions and perceptions and make them at least ""respectful"".

With time, these opinions and perceptions become more respected and popular, as they are supported by the media, artistically, politically, culturally, legally and academically...etc.

Whoever invented this modernist phrase would not have even dreamed that it would cause psychological and intellectual fragility in individuals and societies, making them truly believe that their opinions are valuable and carry a point of view, whatever those opinions are.

They can no longer bear to be told, “Your idea is of no value,” or that your idea is, for example, stupid or funny.

I believe that our current generation never differentiates between the concept of respect for human beings and the concept of respect for human opinions,

Any criticism of his ideas and convictions is a direct criticism of his identity and being

This generation and beyond - and I am from it - needs a lot of work and education to realize this idea

Also, to transform from a childish psychological structure that cries and screams when it is not appreciated or encouraged, to a mature and realistic psyche that is capable of receiving blows."	Reddit

Negative thinking…:especially when trying to take action on certain things. 

After about 20 minutes he said that I have issues with an Inner Struggle with my “Reptilian Brain” and My “Higher Brain”. 

Which I do agree!!

For the next 20 minutes he made me close my eyes and picture my reptilian Brain on my left hand….then my right brain on my right…..kept asking me questions for each part of my brain/hand and to answer what first came up…..the conclusion was my reptilian brain was trying to keep me safe and my right mind wants to live a better life

For the next 15 minutes he made me close my eyes and did like Hypnosis session where I had to unite my left hand to my right….to unite both part of my brain because at the end they both want the same goal to keep me happy and safe and repeating a sentence over and over. 

***I had to stop in the middle of it because he said something that got me emotional and a bit teary eyed***

We finished the exercise!.

Gave me homework to write down 10 things I’m grateful for everyday and to call him for a 5 min call when I feel those negative feelings.….and he said that it will take 2 more sessions to resolve the problems…..and that the next session we would “Resolve My Subconscious Traumas”.

I did feel woozy and a bit stunned afterwards….and had to lay on my bed for 30 min after the call. 

Over All I agree with the Idea of ending the inner struggle I have…..but I’m not sure if that session was worth $350???

I know my issues aren’t going to be resolved quickly but I have to analyze if I should ask for my money back.

First, I’m wondering what Robert Dilts’s reputation within the community is. I see in all his bios that he writes that he is one of the founders and highly respected, but I’m not seeing any third parties writing much about him at all.

Second, what is the community’s thoughts of NLP as a therapeutic tool? And if someone markets it as therapy, should that person ethically also have a degree in counseling, social work, psychology, or something along those lines? Is NLP suitable for children’s therapy?

It doesn't have to be generally extreme, just extreme for you.

More of a rant, indulge me.

So I finished my bachelors degree in electronics with 2,3. Yay :)

Had a lovely one month vacation in July were I regularly worked out, enjoyed life and recovered from the brutal exam phase.

Now I started my job at a new company (Industrial air conditioning as commissioning engineer)

I feel at home in the job since it's basically what I've been doing in my apprenticeship and worklife for 4 years.

But:

\- The pay is with 46k just basic. No one in my class makes less.

\- As 100% field staff (which nobody wants to do, since living it a hotel everyweek is ... socially sacrificial) it feels very low. (I have confirmation from this from 5 other companies who offered me a position)

\- They have a ridiculous clause on traveling. Say you have to stay on site for 4 weeks. You get payed to drive to the workplace and if you leave ... but if you wanna spent a weekend at home, you only get gas money and no time. One guy even told me, he fell sick and drove home only for the boss to tell him he won't get payed for the 3,5h drive

\- Every coworker I asked about how the boss handles pay raises, clenched his jaw tightly and then gave me a polite neutral answer. (Except the honest guy. He laughed at me with an ""If you bother him enough he raises. But don't except the world"")

So I basically made my mind up about looking for a new job. Despite me liking the job itself and coworkers.

\_\_\_\_

In my private life:

My neighbor upstairs had water damage, so my bathroom and kitchen is a mold fest. I've got three different types of mold, which is a certain kind of achievement I guess.

Luckily my buddy offered me his flat for cheap, since he left the country for a job opportunity.

&#x200B;

So mold, finding a new job, moving into a new flat, being only at home on the weekends, helping the girlfriend with her new flat.It's all a bit much. And I currently get stressed very easily. Girlfriend wants something and I'm innerly tightening up.

I kinda don't wanna feel this way. Especially since I know I can handle all of this.

Only today I thought about taking care of my mental health in all of this and looking to get atop on this.

Since overwhelmed is something I deal with yearly (:D) it seems like a good idea to get a handle on my emotions.

&#x200B;

Any suggestions?

So far I've noticed that I think about changing the job in an unideal way. Lots of questions I keep repeating internally to which I don't have the answers (yet).Today I tried to switch to thinking about what new job-conditions I actually want and felt better.

The biggest drag is not knowing about specific job offers yet. I got 5 offers from friends in the industry already and my old boss is even bothering my friend ""Whats u/shibiku doing? Ask him. I would hire him on the spot!""But I'd rather searched thoroughly this time. Accepting the first offer (which I did with the current offer ... which was okay, but they obscured all of the stuff I'm now unhappy with during the interview. Despite me directly asking about it ...) didn't do me good."	Reddit

Does anyone have a positive experience with a NLP technique in the bedroom? :)

I'm over 30 years old and I've had different sex experiences (with steady boyfriends and a few ""experiments"" :P). Although I can (pretty easily) reach orgasms by myself, I've never reached one with a man yet. Not even through oral sex. They all tried, but somehow I couldn't get there, even if I felt excited and relaxed. And there wasn't any mental pressure.

My intention is to share this wonderful experience with a man (in general, not a certain person). So I'd like to experiment with NLP. I've only read here postings from guys (anchoring technique)...are there any women out there, who took the matter into their hands (hihi) and got good results? I'm not sure I can anchor myself...and right now I don't have a partner, with whom I can try things out. But I have the curiosity and the time to experiment, so that I can improve my sex life for my next partnership :D.

I'm very thankful for any recommendation/ idea.

One thing that I always find confusing is when he tells someone to ""spin"" an emotion ""round and round"". My best guess, based on what I've seen and heard from his lectures and seminars, is that the listener is to learn how to make the unconscious mental processes that create an emotion conscious. Is that correct? If so, how long did it take you to learn how to do it? In his seminars he seems to expect people to do it instantly -- ""double it, double it, double it"".  

On a side note, using his techniques I can whip myself into a rage pretty quickly but to bring up those good feelings takes a good bit of work. Are there some emotions that are just easier to ""spin""?"	Reddit

I'm hoping you can help me with a problem I'm having.


I can visualize, however when I try to change this image, e.g. make part of it smaller, further away, black and white etc. In my visualisation the image always returns to it's original state.


It's like I'm trying to make it change, and it starts to, but then something changes it back.


It's not that I lose the image, and when it returns it's the original - I can literally see the image changing back.


Has anyone else had this problem?
Do you know of any solutions?


Thanks for your help!

640	Is there a way to improve aggression through NLP?		2021-07-21 12:14:34+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/ooonp0/is_there_a_way_to_improve_aggression_through_nlp/	Before anything I don't mean becoming violent or even socially assertive per say. I'm curious if NLP can help raising reward sensitivity. By 'agression' I mean becoming more competitive and determined instead of looking for excuses and outside help. Many times when I face a challenge my first response is to deny it, avoid it, let anyone else take the prize just so I don't have to endavour and care. This is not what helps when taken to extreme. The core of it lies in fear. I care first about how others feel about my actions and how instant responses of enviroment are affecting my progress instead of beliving I can and will finish what I started despite obstacles. Forgive me if I choose wrong words but did I come to right place or should look somewhere else?	Reddit

So I've been here only a few weeks and my next door neighbour really upset me and made me angry by something he did and said towards me.

He is very similar to the type of negative, mean spirited person I initially wanted to move away from.

For the past few days I've been really stressed and angry that I now have to live and deal with the exact type of person I wanted to avoid.

To the point where I'm thinking of moving back to my previous place. But, I do not want to do that because I know I will have to deal with negative people no matter where I go in life. So I want to learn how to deal with it.

My mother used to extrapolate what could go wrong of me doing something and immeadiatly tell me beforehand. Taking out the freshly washed dishes ""Don't drop them!""  
I asked her directly once and she told told me ""Yes, handling you, I first think about mitigating everything that could go wrong.""  
I'm over that, but I think explaining where it comes from seems easier to understand to you guys.  


**So what I do while taking out the garbage (literal scenario)**  
I open the fenced-off common garbage-area, I dispose of my first batch, I leave the door open (since I will be back right away to dispose of my second batch)   
In my head, I create some unreasonable neighbor complaining ""Why do you leave the door open?!"" and considering submodalities ... the submodalities are unpleasant. I dialogue inside my head explaining it to them, they complaing more ... a scenario I can't win.  
I live there since 6 years. NEVER has anyone been bothered about me leaving the door open!  


And I do scenarios like this - where my behaviour clashes with some inner ruleset - more than I would like.  


So I thought about installing a new inner voice ... a pleasant one

My choice: Will Smith  
(Currently sitting in a cafe, trying to figure out how to go about this.)  
1. Listen some Wills Smith interview

2. Replicate the voice inside my head and modulate it

3. Repetition of Number 2  
4. Consciously do a trigger heavy activity (taking out the garbage, leaving the door open)  
5. Consciously using Will Smith's voice to ""judge"" the situation  
6. Doing this consciscouly over and over again. Making it enjoyable on the way.

But I find this most useful while helping people. And it's also my favorite. It's ""Experience has a structure.""

No matter how bizarre a situation the client has gone through, this presupposition helps me keep calm when I listen to them. It reminds me not to get carried away by their story. Ultimately it's just a structure consisting of modalities and sub-modalities. So I pay attention to how the experience is being projected in their mind. And it helps me instantly develop rapport and empathy with them.

Later on because of the fragmentation of NLP into different camps in 80s and 90s, lead to fragmentation of knowledge as well, and as such a number of courses came by, different models were brought into these courses, and unfortunately there was no central body to manage what was going on, hence, the quality of courses dropped. Trainers with half baked information started to train in NLP with their own map,  and that created a lot of issues that we see in NLP during present times. 

NLP based coaching is probably a subset of classic NLP Practitioner and Master Practitioner programs. While the coaching fraternity development and emerged alongside NLP, but coaching community eventually was limited to a few accreditation bodies, ICF and EMCC being the most prominent ones. 

A lot of NLP coaches have aligned with ICF, because ICF keeps a check on what is being offered, and under the ethics, standards and guidelines of coaching umbrella. 

Now if you are looking for an NLP course, but with more of Coaching flavor. Look for a coaching course delivered by an NLP Trainer who has learnt NLP from Richard Bandler, John Grinder, Robert Dilts, Judith, Steve, Michael Hall, Steve Gilligan, Joseph OC, and other known NLP trainers, and have specifically attended a coaching courses from Master Coach Trainers associated with different accreditation bodies like ICF, EMCC, or Meta Coaching. If you are looking to specifically looking to use NLP knowledge in Life Coaching[How to become a Life Coach](https://nlpcoach.in/how-to-become-a-life-coach-in-india/), Leadership Coaching, Wellness Coaching, then this approach of learning from someone who knows both NLP, and has good understanding of coaching helps. 

The blend of NLP and looking at the concepts of NLP in a coaching frame would enable a trainer to develop and deliver a world class NLP coaching course."	Reddit

I wanted to share this post as a way of making contact with other NLP students around the world so we can share information and grow together.

&#x200B;

Here in Brazil, we have many NLP schools that teach distorted information. It´s very rare to find people that can stick to the original NLP models or at least add more quality to them without taking any information away (when teaching). As a result, we have a very poor NLP community.  


I have the opportunity to learn from Dr. Nelson Spritzer, PhD, here in my hometown Porto Alegre (@drnelsonspritzer on IG). He learned NLP and then trained with Richard Bandler's supervision for some weeks, so his model is splendid. Besides that, he was a Cardiology researcher for many years, so he is absolutely careful with the information he shares and has very good criteria to make his choices. He really is an example of what he´s teaching: a model of wisdom, health and good choicemaking. 

&#x200B;

I believe NLP can really impact the humanity in a good way. If people knew more about the way their unconscious mind works and the techniques to control it, we would really see our race have better results in many spheres: individually, colectively, with earth,... and others. Thats why I´m looking to put myself in good comunities with people that are like the idea of quality NLP being more accessible to the people.

Our need food, water, sleep, exercise, money, etc.

But as human beings we also have 'higher' needs.  Our need to actualize our potential, our need to become the best version of ourselves, to express ourselves fully, our need to continually improve....  

These needs are just as real as our need for food and water --- they just operates in a different way.

As a coach, leader and/or someone interested in developing your potential this is an important distinction to understand.

The most famous model of self-actualization is Abraham Maslow’s hierarchy of needs model where at the bottom of the pyramid are our survival needs, above that is security, and then social, self-esteem and at the top of the pyramid are these higher 'self-actualization' needs.

As human beings we start at the bottom of the pyramid at our survival needs and as we gratify those sufficiently we are freed to move up to the next level.

An example that I use to describe this is to imagine that you are under water holding your breath.

In the beginning it is likely that you can really enjoy being under water. You can relax, think about your goals, reflect on your life, and just enjoy yourself.

As time goes on however, as your lower need for oxygen remains ungratified, more and more of your attention gets pulled toward gratifying that need.

Eventually it can reach the point where someone could lose their sense of self, lose their values, and might even consciously or unconsciously drown another individual just to get some air because every single cell in one's body becomes devoted toward that one task — meeting that lower need. 

One of the amazing things about our lower needs is that the second that you get a deep breath of oxygen, air is the last thing on your mind. Almost immediately you are freed up to focus on other things in your life.

The lower needs work in this way. They unlock level upon level as you sufficiently gratify the level below: The less you have, the more you need them. The second you fulfill them, they completely drop out of consciousness.

This is not the same as how our self-actualization needs work. Perhaps surprisingly they work in quite the opposite way.  The more you get them the more you want them!

The more the painter paints, the more they want to paint.

The more the singer sings, the more they want to sing.

The more you express yourself fully the more you want to express yourself fully.

But there is a problem with this...

We are not able to visit in this 'higher' realm, let alone live there, until our lower needs are sufficiently gratified.

Every morning we wake up and we need to eat again. Every night we need to sleep again. Every month we need to pay our bills.

If you try to live at the peak without meeting your lower needs you will eventually burn out or need to divert your path. It is just not sustainable.

It is only when we have systems in place to consistently gratify our lower needs that we are able to free up our inner vitality to really focus on what it is that we are best at - what it is we are meant to do in this world.

Let's take a moment of self-reflection:

* How well are you meeting your lower needs on a consistent basis? Perhaps your focus could be on implementing strategies to meet these lower needs in a systematic way.

* Where would you say that you are currently living in terms of Maslow's pyramid? Are you more focused on survival, security, social, or at the top of the pyramid?   This self-assessment will give you a system for knowing what to prioritize for the next stage of your development.

* At what level are you focusing your vitality at this stage of development and is that aligned with your needs? For example if you are really focused on getting a relationship, but are unable to pay your bills you may want to reconsider your priorities.

In better understanding how our needs work we can gain perspective as to what our sticking points are and we can realign our priorities at each stage of our development to make ongoing progress towards unleashing our highest and best potential as a human being."	Reddit

The bump we ""have to get over"" when starting out, that feels awkward and how to tackle that. Not a guide, just talking bs about the topic. Coffeebreak-style.

&#x200B;

Multiple endeavors I have are pretty easy and fulfilling once I get going and do it habitually for a few days. Then life gets in the way, I study for so long I forget what sunlights looks like and come out of my one-sided hermit-crab study-lifestyle after a few weeks - dumbfounded and confused.

&#x200B;

* Today is the day I start fitness back up!
* Today is the day I continue my journal and goal-setting excercises!
* Today is the day I restart the meditation habit I had going!

But it feels weird and not at all as smooth as it used to be. Or when starting something new, it's a complex mess and I don't know where to start to get a pleasing, smooth and good result.

**What doesn't work at all** (I've tried) is working around the problem. I spent a good 30minutes thinking ""Ah, maybe I need more inspiration."" watching YouTube Videos on Journaling to get my creative juices going. And yet nothing. The perfect moment to start didn't come.Maybe a 20min. meditation session to get my mind off of things. So the fairy of inspiration can descent from the heavens ... nothing.

**What does work** ... at least the only solution ""to get back into the game"" I have found was to start where I am.

Starting up journaling or written excercises, I screw up the first page. Just writing it without coherent thought out plan or prettiness to it. Messy, unsorted and somewhat uncomfortable. Exactly how I feel towards the subject actually. Then out of that ... a more refined version emerges.

Same with fitness. Dragging my ass along the excercises thinking ""This is dumb and stupid"" evolves into liking it a little bit.

I haven't completly accepted that (it seems) the only way back into the habit/task is through the first messy minutes of it, though."	Reddit
726	6 Models to Take Your NLP to the Next Level	perceptionacademy	2021-04-22 17:56:25+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/mwal6v/6_models_to_take_your_nlp_to_the_next_level/	"Want to go beyond the original NLP Models?  Here are 6 Neuro-Semantic models that will greatly expand your capabilities as a NLP Practitioner and Coach.

Model #1: The Meta-States Model - For Unconscious Communication
Beyond the traditional communication model of NLP the Meta-States model opens us to much more accurately track and transform the higher levels of mind, belief systems, inner dialogue, and all of the meta levels of the mind in a systemic and organized manner.

Acknowledged by INLPTA in 1995 as “the most significant contribution to NLP”, Meta-States model give us the ability to track back from someone’s behavior and representations up to the layers and layers of thoughts in the back of the mind that govern that experience all the way back down to our resulting behavior.

Model #2: The Axes of Change Model - For Change & Learning
The Axis of Change incorporates the four key mechanisms for generative change – Motivation, Decision, Creation and Solidification. Not only does it create a structured framework for coaching conversations, but it will make your blind spots as a practitioner blatantly obvious and give you a clear path to expand your personal growth, coaching, and communication skills.

Designed for generative change, the Axes of Change Model results in change that is sustainable without the resistance and relapse features that characterize many other models designed for more remedial change.

This model dramatically transformed the way that I do coaching and is a powerful change model that I use in my sales process as well as to enhance all of my other NLP techniques.

Model #3: The Benchmarking Model – For Measurement & Implementation
By its nature subjective experience is... subjective!

Would you like to learn a model that you can use to make intangible experiences more objective and measurable?

At its core the Neuro-Semantic Benchmarking model is based upon the ability to use the Meta-Model and to de-nominalize terms back down to their sensory based referents – but it takes this process so much farther.

In fact, this art has been refined over and over again in each competency based Meta-Coach Certification Training.

The practice of Neuro-Semantic benchmarking has massively transformed my ability to stretch my global-detail & intuitor-sensor meta-programs with truly life changing consequences.

Applying this model allows us to take our outcomes, values, skills and experiences and make them measurable so we can better track the growth, learning and development of ourselves and those whom we work with.

Model #4:  The Self-Actualization Quadrants - For Self-Actualization
If you know me at all you know that in my opinion — Self-Actualization is the highest frame within which to practice NLP, Coaching, and Neuro-Semantics.  Self-Actualization is the larger frame from in which we can check the ecology of any system or change, and when we focus on unleashing the highest and best of ourselves and our clients everything else falls into place.

Model #5: The Matrix Model – For Systemic Thinking
The Matrix Model is designed as a systems model for thinking and working systemically with people, groups and organizations.  In Neuro-Semantics we use the Matrix Model for working with the multiple layers of meaning frames that create and describe the client’s world so that we can “follow the energy through the system”.

Starting with any external event, the matrix model allows us to track the process of embodying that information, processing that information, metabolizing that information into energy and embodying it into the state from which our behaviors flow out of.

We use the Matrix Model and its 7 matrices as a template for gathering and sorting information, for profiling, modeling, and working with the systemic complexity of human experience.

Model #6: The Facilitation Model – For Facilitating Change
When you coach/communicate with others (or yourself) do you tend to be too soft, empathetic and supportive?

Or perhaps you fall on the other side of the spectrum overly pushing and challenging in your communications.

The Neuro-Semantic Facilitation Model organizes the 7 core skills of Coaching/Communication onto the Meaning and Performance Axes so we can stretch ourselves as facilitators and take ourselves to the next level as agents of change.

Not only that, but it ‘facilitates’ you to find your perfect balance between being ruthlessly challenging and compassionately supportive.

When I first discovered this model I (like many other coaches) tended to be overly supportive in my coaching to the detriment of my clients.  Now I have the permission, capability, and experience of challenging my clients to take action and to stretch which has had dramatic effects in their (as well as my own) performance.

728	Doing NLP 'on' People vs. 'with' People	perceptionacademy	2021-04-20 18:06:41+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/muwgkn/doing_nlp_on_people_vs_with_people/	"As a NLP practitioner I was taught step-by-step processes/patterns that I could do ‘on’ somebody.

It was completely normal in that NLP culture for me to say something like “I just did NLP on him” or “She just did NLP on me”, or ""They just NLPed me"".

When I started learning/practicing Neuro-Semantic NLP one of the differences in culture was the shift from the focus on 'the process' to the focus on 'the person' and 'the relationship'.

Rather than practicing NLP 'on’ people, we practiced our NLP 'with’ people.

A slightly different way of framing it with a massive real-world impact in my life.

In terms of my day to day communications and relationships this re-frame supports me in building more authentic rapport with others. 

It supports me in building more genuinely caring relationships.  

It supports me in generating long term, sustainable, win-win relationships personally and professionally. 

This reframe supports me in more healthy and respectful communication patterns and it supports me in treating others as I would like to be treated.

In terms of coaching relationships this way of operating supports me in building collaborative relationships with my clients in service of them and their desired outcomes. 

It supports my clients to feel more empowered to take responsibility for their own results, increases their personal power, and it demonstrates as a role model a much more resourceful way of how to relate with other people.

With over ten years having passed since I shifted this way of thinking for myself I can say from my personal experience that doing NLP 'with people' has been much more powerful for me than doing NLP 'on people'."	Reddit

743	How I Built My Coaching Practice	perceptionacademy	2021-04-09 19:42:38+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/mnp0et/how_i_built_my_coaching_practice/	"Are you starting your coaching practice?   Perhaps you have been coaching for some time now but still aren’t as confident in your skills as you would like to be, even though you are excited to share your tools with the world?

Recently I received a question from a client asking how I built my practice, and how I was able to build trust in myself and my skills.
Below is the first part of my reply...

To begin, I practiced at every opportunity I could. There are some skills where I needed to have someone’s permission and make it more formal of a coaching session, but there were also skills that could be practiced more informally and conversationally. 

For example, whenever I would be buying something I would practice basic rapport, listening, questioning with the person at the register. I would practice shifting the state of somebody sitting next to me on the bus, at the crosswalk or at the cafe. Any opportunity I got I would practice for free.

I asked anyone and everyone if I could practice X technique with them or do Y process to help them achieve an outcome.  

A basic script of what I would ask people was something along the lines of:
“Hi! I have been training as a coach and was wondering if you would be open to experiencing a 25 minute session with me. Worst case scenario things are exactly the same but we could potentially help you make a big impact in your life that otherwise wouldn’t have happened.  Would you be open to this?”

Or “Hey, I learned a process that could help you achieve X. Would you be open to experiencing this with me? It only takes 15-20 minutes. Worst case scenario you end up exactly the same but many people share that this has had a profound impact for them.  Would you be open to experience this with me?”

I found that having a time frame was important because you don’t want it to go on forever.  Whether it is 15 minutes, 30 minutes, or an hour, I would invite people to experience free sessions with me and at the end I would ask them for their feedback.

* What did I do that you loved in that session?
* What was the best skill I demonstrated?
* What could I have said, done, or asked that would have taken your experience to the next level?

In fact, after 10 years of experience as a coach I still ask these questions after many of my sessions.  Honest feedback is one of the best ways to increase your competence. And if they share that they enjoyed the session, you can always ask for a testimonial and/or referral. If you sense that they got a lot of value you can also invite them to work with you more formally.

Some Questions...	samcro4eva	2021-04-09 00:11:17+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/mn56bn/new_here_some_questions/	"My first question would be how best to absorb the information in NLP. It's a lot, even going by what's in the NLP For Dummies book. I'm familiar with the hypnosis aspect, but the rest is a lot for me to take in.

Second question... given what little I do know about NLP, I've seen a lot of information and techniques from a man whose material was required reading for a course I was taking. His name is Dr. H. Norman Wright. I'm wondering if anyone has any information on his studying NLP. His model of the brain, advice on building rapport, and even some techniques he shows on reducing stress, seem like they're based on NLP (one of his techniques I recognized as hypnosis), and he recommends hypnotic training like EMDR.

Third question... I've noticed that there are various ways to group together Milton Model and hypnotic techniques phenomenologically, such as yes/no sets and pacing/leading as a following phenomenon. Has anyone else noticed this, and does it make for easier learning?

I look forward to any insight on these questions"	Reddit
745	Creating the Space for Your Coaching Clients to Speak Their Truth & Open Up about their Real Issues	perceptionacademy	2021-04-07 15:02:53+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/mm42pf/creating_the_space_for_your_coaching_clients_to/	"I was recently asked by a client, “How do I build the rapport, safety and vulnerability in my coaching so a client can feel safe to speak their truths?”.

Beyond the basic NLP rapport techniques there are many coaching skills & states that support this process which is so crucial to being effective as a coach.

AWARENESS OF THE CONTEXT My first consideration would be the context with which the person came to you. Did they come by choice? Were they forced to work with you? Did they come to you tentatively or with desire? Did they invest money to have this meeting? All of these factors will help determine the level of ‘rapport’ right out of the gate. The more desiring, willing, and invested they are as a general rule the more open they will be to share more deeply.

DEVELOPING YOUR SKILLS OF LISTENING AND SUPPORTING Most people are not aware of their ‘real’ problems’ or ‘real goals’ — or at least they aren’t very clear on how to communicate them. So they will test you with smaller problems/pseudo problems and see how you respond before bringing the ‘real’/’deeper’ issues to the table. How do you handle these?

Do you default quickly to giving advice? Or do you actively & non-judgmentally listen, ask exploratory questions, acknowledge what you are hearing, check that you are understanding correctly, summarize what you have heard, etc. Do you separate out pseudo problems & symptoms from the real issues and hear what isn’t being stated directly?

Do you call them out when you calibrate that they are being inauthentic, shallow, or playing it safe and invite them to get real? These skills will allow them to feel safe, supported, understood and build trust in your competence & caring so they will be more comfortable to share their deeper, more meaningful issues.

DEVELOPING YOUR DEEP QUESTIONING SKILLS Ask deeper questions that pull them one level deeper than they have shared and see if you have resistance or if they follow your lead. In many contexts it is our job as a ‘coach’ to invite the deeper sharing rather than to ‘wait for it’.

DEVELOPING YOUR SKILL OF FRAMING Setting frames up front can help accelerate this process. Let them know that your conversations are confidential (because most of your clients refer their friends and colleagues to you or whatever reason is authentic to you). Let them know up front that you’re going to ask them deeper questions to get to the heart of what is most important. Let them know up front that the more real they are, the more real/authentic their results will be, etc.

What frames can you set at the beginning of your sessions/meetings that will allow them to feel more comfortable/help resolve some resistance they may be feeling to authentically share?

DEVELOPING YOUR COACHING STATE Lastly for now, how well do you unconditionally accept your clients? How well can you appreciate them as people and even appreciate their ‘problems’/parts of themselves that even they don’t appreciate about themselves yet? How much can you see them as a unique and sacred individual on a growth journey? How much do you put yourself aside and so they can sense it is all about them rather than about you, your ego, or you getting results. And again, how well can you ‘just listen’ and explore without the need to change anything. All of these things will support them in feeling safe and supported and accelerate the process of opening up. (All of these states can be cultivated more deeply in yourself with the tools in our State Elicitation course).

All of these skills and states will support you in your coaching to create the safe space your clients need to open up and discover the real and significant issues in their life that will create meaningful change to make your work so valuable they can’t help but actively promote and praise you and your work."

His:

""At the beginning you are an uninhibited lightbulb of childlike motivation, curiosity and pure energy. Then more or less layers of rules, habits and trauma are put on top. Dimming the level of energy, flexibility of actions and range of emotions. Peeling back those layers of indoctrination, bad habits and unsolved traumata to reveal the uninhibited you is the way to go. Once your free of the old ways, new ways form automatically.""  


vs.

  
Mine:

""You take your current level of extra time and energy, however little it may be and invest it into a new behaviour or thought. You are somewhat aware of what works against you and somewhat aware what does work for you. So you keep repeating what works for you, cause that will make you happier and more energetic. Being happier and more energetic you tend to make even more life affirming decisions. Building up a new way of life like a castle. Somehow forgetting the old behaviours and coping mechanisms you used to have, by finding new and better ways to live life.""  


Condendsed down it's ""Build the new, old gets forgotten on the way"" vs. ""Clean the old, the new comes automatically""  


All in all we both come to the same conclusion. By raising your well-being, life gets better. We just differ on the way to raise that well-being.

Paradoxically enough, he tends to implement new behaviours through discipline really easy, yet they have seldom much effect (think Jojo-Diet). While I can take his approach of ""cleaning up the past"" with ease and talk about traumatic events in such a positive manner, it's reworked into assets instead of hindrances, yet I see no benefit.

Explaining the whole concept of sub-modalities to a non-NLP-indoctrinated leaves me struggling to find good explanations or just doesn't blow my audience out of the water.  
Some may have heard the Bandler story about Nikolai Tesla (scientist) and how he built an exact copy of his lab inside his head. Visualizing experiments during train rides, to later test them in his real workshops. His imaginary workshop coming rather close to the real thing.  


So this is what I wanna talk about. Being intrigued what you have to share.  


I'll give an example of something I can do, but have no idea if it is special or not, since I never told anyone.

I record voices with an eery accuracy in my head. Being able to play whole conversations or snippets that caught my interest back like a tape-recorder.   
It's normal memory so it quickly fades if it's non-impactful, but as memory goes can be excercised.

Also I can hear someones voice and basically let them say anything I want in my head, while also changing tonality.  
I have no idea what to do with this or how I could use this to improve myself, but it is kinda cool.  
So far I just dabble around and let voices from people I admire, love or like sometimes tell me I did good or that I look cute."	Reddit

a) smoke a cigarette

b) take a nap

Despite my best efforts I have had a hard time making changes stick.  Frankly, I have reverted on 99% of the change work I have done.  The only thing I have made stick was silly.  I renewed my taste for an album that I played out more than twenty years ago by mapping it across to something new and exciting.  (Pretty Hate Machine by Nine Inch Nails for those who are curious.)  As a result I finally got around to playing with something that my trainer called tasking.
      I haven't seen this discussed anywhere so I'm posting it here in hopes that I  can help someone to help themselves.  It was taught to me that getting the client where they want to be while in the session is on the practitioner but once the client is back out in the world the responsibility for staying there is on them.  This is where tasking comes in.  Tasking is assigning the client (of in this case, yourself) homework designed to keep them in the effective mindset that was created during the session.  In my personal case, I have a list of statements of intent on my closet door that I read multiple times per day with the intent of taking the meaning of the statement into my current state.  It's kind of like an affirmation however it works better than affirmations alone.  In this case, I have created a change with NLP and am using the statement of intent to reaffirm the change that I made rather than trying to convince myself of something by repetition alone.
     The second thing that I want to stress is for those who lean more toward the kinesthetic end of things.  When I talk about the statements on my closet door I mean that I write them in a way that I will feel when I read them.  Then, As I read the statements of intent I take a second to really dwell in how the intent of the statement feels.  Over a short time you will be better able to sustain the feeling for longer and longer.
     Third, even though it is taught that when mapping across, you map across the visual submodalities don't be afraid to try mapping across auditory and kinesthetic also.  Mapping across kinesthetic submodalities is how I got myself to enjoy Pretty Hate Machine again."	Reddit

793	Loneliness - What triggers makes us actually think our social needs are not satisfied and how to change all of it (Discussion)	shibiku_	2021-02-21 19:41:53+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/lp4t0x/loneliness_what_triggers_makes_us_actually_think/	"Inspiration was this video from kurzgesagt

[https://youtu.be/n3Xv\_g3g-mA](https://youtu.be/n3Xv_g3g-mA)

Short-Synopsis: ""Like hunger, loneliness is a indicating pain that some need is not met.""

Then it gets into how loneliness can warp the individuals perception of social interactions towards ""She didn't like me""/""I don't belong""

&#x200B;

So given the mighty sword of ""Your brain can't differentiate between real experience and thought"" that's on the core of many NLP-Techniques, is it possible to satisfy our inner hunger for social acceptance through NLP?

I've been toying around with this a lot, cause (I'm crazy) ... my social skills are not the best. So I have built many behaviors around this.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Structuring the inner world towards ""Nobody likes me"" - while searching for proof in the real world to justify that belief - is described in the aforementioned video.

Which is easy to do, since lots of social interactions can have something that can be misinterpreted and dwelled upon. Very easy to have resistance towards something and then gnaw on that one remark - that sounded like something your dad said to you when you were little - for the rest of the evening.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Restructuring said world towards something more healthy like ""Some people like me, some love me and a few find me attractive"" is a very doable endeavor and affirmation that triggers happiness in me. (Worked a lot on this, so I can swallow it somewhat without resistance. Tweaking the audio-submodalities towards a believable, pleasant voice was good here)

\_\_\_\_\_\_

The questions would be:

To which degree should we built our inner world of thoughts towards something that pleases us vs. changing the reality for real?

What would be the best way of changing our inner world towards the better?

Is one ever satisfied with their social interactions and feels constantly like ""they belong"" and ""are loved"" or is one never to be satisfied no matter how much external validation is given?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

&#x200B;

Meta-Commentary

    After this the post becomes more of a rant. The top part is the structured questions and talking topics I wanted to share.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My story here:

Thinking of loneliness as motivating social pain. Without it I wouldn't think much about widening or maintaining my social circle, since for me it's sometimes more work than fun. While I'm socially able and people want to hang out with me, it seldom gives me much. Which is also the main thing girlfriends have broken up with me over ""emotionally unavailable, like a robot.""

Makes sense, my dad has 0 friends - my mom likes the drama of people for entertainment and has a gaggle of girlfriends, but keeps them at arms length. They live for their business and only have each other (and their dog, which they adore). So my internal values are skewed towards the same ideals. Or as my first girlfriend described it ""Your family is the coldest I have ever met. Their not dementors in itself, but their presence sure makes the windows freeze over"" I did get two hugs from my mom.

So it's not completely frozen :D

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Let's say the main hiccup with social interactions that leads to pain is resistance.

The breaking of rapport because the other has shown or said something that doesn't sit right with us.

Let's say my distant aunt goes on a rant about how ""Covid-Masks are bullshit""

I know she throws out this generalization of her beliefs, mainly because she can't just swallow the threat of covid. Covid restrictions destroyed her whole service industry business and she didn't have any income since 12.2019 and probably wont have any income till Summer. She's vicious and the tonality in her statement shows.

I would like to break rapport, cause simplifying it to ""Masks are bullshit"" doesn't sit right with me. I would like to get the statement right and bulldoze over her whole statement with ""the truth"" (my truth). But that doesn't get me anywhere in terms of rapport and social joy.

Leaving myself behind to go into her rabbit hole of frustration and anger would connect me with her, but I get a feeling of cringe and mini-vomit just thinking about it. Not really worth it

While I actually haven't talked to that aunt in 2 years. I have this exact problem in almost of all of my social interactions. Nobody fits perfect and my inability to be flexible, go into their world and be interested into going into their world causes me loneliness.

I have recognized that this is a problem in my life and are looking for ways to change this. Fiddling around with my inner world of thought and beliefs seems like a good start. Especially since forcing myself towards social groups is an ongoing theme in my life, which I dislike most of the time.

The only social situation where I listen like a hawk to what people are saying and are interested is the NLP Groups I managed in my city (Died due to covid :/). Luckily my job will give me enough financial freedom to travel to a bigger city and hopefully get a bigger NLP group going again after Covid subdues (2024 \*fingers crossed\*). So that's my current hope to get a social circle going that I share an interest with.

After a series of panic attacks over the weekend because of noisy neighbors(which led my heart to physically hurt while I tried to sleep), I need some help on triggering a resourceful state. There's a number of situations where I can see myself needing this:  
  
* After work (when I'm burnt out from doing sales all day)  
   
* When I'm getting in the zone to run my small businesses, where I require some extra motivation to do a variety of work activities(speaking with suppliers, cold-calling customers, admin. work, tech. support, etc.)  
  
* When I need to be assertive, deal with confrontational tasks, or things that provoke my anxiety  
  
* When I'm going through a ""destructive"" state, like the neighbors making too much noise but can't ask them to turn it down any lower, or when I'm feeling helpless and repeatedly more angry (as mentioned) 

As you can tell all of this stuff is related to me internally. I'm not looking to guide others to entering a more resourceful state, I really just want to command it within myself, so I can better tackle obstacles of my life.   
      
Keep in mind that, having been in the sales industry for about a decade of my life already, I probably already have a basic background of NLP. I also work with a therapist who has an NLP background and explained some of these things to me, like pattern interrupts.  

* Are there any good books for working on this sort of thing?  
  
* Since I'm looking specifically to work on things internally, do I even need to read any longer books? If not, what are some guides, websites, blogs, videos, etc. that can be just as helpful?  
  
* What are some ways where I can work on triggering a resourceful state?"	Reddit

When its about recalling previous events, I just cant get my self into any of the states, positive or negative. I am still trying now and then, to slowly recall the images, smells, sounds or feeling but the more I try, the more it is for me to concetrate and recall any of those.

Maybe important to mention, there was also some traumatic events in the last few years, like deaths and accidents, but I didnt feel anything or had any phobias/traumas afterwards.

839	Innervoice type based, or NLP 'based' or NA?	foxieluxie	2021-01-06 12:19:44+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/krmtd0/innervoice_type_based_or_nlp_based_or_na/	"Hi everyone, I was wondering based on a post about inner voices if people who don't have them are more inclined to be a specific enneagram type or if they cannot visualize and therefore not be able to do many types of NLP ""tricks"" (sorry couldn't find a better word for it). 

A friend I know says he has no inner voice. ""My voice is my voice?"" Pretty much and he's a type 6w5. Any NLP ""tricks"" I tried with/on him didn't work because he had a hard time visualizing and pretty much couldn't at all. 

So what do you think? Or can someone enlighten me on the subject?"	Reddit

When I'm angry the only thing I can think of as a relief is smoking. In those situation I am stubborn and dumb and not really open. Thinking is not my strong suit in those situations.

848	How can I use NLP to forget and stop associating events in the past with current ones?	Cautious_Number_95	2020-12-29 21:05:35+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/kmmybr/how_can_i_use_nlp_to_forget_and_stop_associating/	In the past I used to hang out with a group who bullied me alot. Made fun of me and people even told me but I let it go. Eventually I removed them from my life. But each time some one in a group even remotely insults me the situation becomes exactly like what it was with my ex-friends. It sucks. It ruins so many fun moments. Banter is supposed to be fun but by connecting it with the times I was bullied in past makes me hate it.	Reddit

856	What are your go-to motivational techniques? (Here's mine)	shibiku_	2020-12-17 10:24:14+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/keuzlm/what_are_your_goto_motivational_techniques_heres/	"I'm a big ""once I've started, I can't stop""-guy. But to get over the hump or analyzing why I've got trouble getting over the hump, I usually do this:

\- Chunk down

\- Make a mental picture of the end result and dwell on it for 7 seconds (enhancing it via sub modalities till it gives of a blissfull vibe)

\- Stare at the beast from afar and let the built up associations/inner dialog go through yourself consciously. Just bare through it with a cup of tea in hand. (In this example I look at the basement cellar until my mind starts to sort it out mentally how I could get a handle on things)

\- Usually staying conscious and aware is what does the trick  


\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_Cunk down\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If I postpone or feel unmotivated:  
Mostly the task is to big in my mind an no clear path is set (Chunks are to big to comprehend/swallow)  
So I'll chunk it down and walk myself trough it on paper  


Example Task: Clean the basement

Internal Dialogue pre-technique:  
*""Jesus, where do I even begin. There so much to do and then the stuff I should sell on ebay"" - downward spiraling into demotivation.*

&#x200B;

1. **Clean basement**

1.1 Take everything out of the room, starting with the one corner

1.2 Look at everything individually and sort it into categories

1.3 Take the easiest to fullfill category and complete it

1.4 Don't go into to much depth with big categories that feel like a rabbits hole. Just sort them aside for now (They have to be chunked down separately)

Like instead of finesse in the right direction, it happens to be in the exact wrong direction.  Emotion also plays a role and causes a sort of loop.  Maybe I don’t need to give an explanation, but you can get in sort of a negative loop, even if things are mostly working, or should be working, that are definitely not working as they should.  Is there anything NLP can offer to stop it, and prevent it?	Reddit

I’m In the process on going back to college but I can’t for the life of me get myself to study and read educational stuff (the enjoyment is gone!) like I used to since I’m out of habit due to me being distracted with the family.

878	How can we selectively mentally associate/connect one thought with another?	UmbralNight	2020-11-23 17:44:44+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/NLP/comments/jzmekq/how_can_we_selectively_mentally_associateconnect/	"Hello, Im new here an was wondering, how can we connect one thought with another selectively?

I recall this is related to the subconscious but looking at it from a very practical perspective.

Allow me to describe what I mean by that question, Sometimes we might be in a place and hear something, the brain/mind will correlate that room or environment with the sound or/and the situation, the next time we revisit that room we recall the incident.

How do we do that in the first place? How would you go about selectively disconnecting and connecting them?

I have noticed this happens when we look at trauma, by observing we start to disconnect the negative emotion from the memory or similar.

I am trying to understand more in detail how this happens and how to willingly make it happen both ways to develop certain good habits and of course help with getting through trauma. Practically and in a relatable way if possible.

While at it, I know memes are somehow related to this dynamic.  
Its also noticed on how we correlate words (them being symbols) with experiences which in turn form a language, I am curious about this too.

Any information will be appreciated.

Thanks"	Reddit
