With ChatGPT, I just plug it everything I have in my pantry and refrigerator and it spits out a few recipes. And if I need more information or want to add/change an ingredient, I just ask. This is a big deal because I’m in to fitness and eating healthy is always a struggle. Took me 49 years but I can finally say I enjoy cooking! 	Reddit
16	I Built an LLM Framework in just 100 Lines!!	Willing-Site-8137	2025-01-03 16:25:06+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hsq9sj/i_built_an_llm_framework_in_just_100_lines/	"I've seen lots of complaints about how complex frameworks like LangChain are. Over the holidays, I wanted to explore just how minimal an LLM framework could be if we stripped away every unnecessary feature.

For example, why even include OpenAI wrappers in an LLM framework??

* **API Changes:** OpenAI API evolves (client after 0.27), and the official libraries often introduce bugs or dependency issues that are a pain to maintain.
* **DIY Is Simple:** It's straightforward to generate your own wrapper—just feed the latest vendor documentation to an LLM!
* **Extendibility:** By avoiding vendor-specific wrappers, developers can easily switch to other open-source or self-deployed models..

Similarly, I strip out features that could be built on-demand rather than baked into the framework. The result? I created a 100-line LLM framework: [https://github.com/miniLLMFlow/miniLLMFlow](https://github.com/miniLLMFlow/miniLLMFlow)

These 100 lines capture what I see as the core abstraction of most LLM frameworks: a nested directed graph that breaks down tasks into multiple LLM steps, with branching and recursion to enable agent-like decision-making. From there, you can:

* **Layer On Complex Features:** I’ve included examples for building [agents](https://minillmflow.github.io/miniLLMFlow/agent.html), [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://minillmflow.github.io/miniLLMFlow/rag.html), [chat memory](https://minillmflow.github.io/miniLLMFlow/memory.html), and more.
* **Work Seamlessly With Coding Assistants:** Because it’s so minimal, it integrates well with coding assistants like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-677464af36588191b9eba4901946557b-mini-llm-flow-assistant), Claude, and Cursor.ai. You only need to share the relevant [documentation ](https://github.com/miniLLMFlow/miniLLMFlow/tree/main/docs)(e.g., in the Claude project), and the assistant can help you build new workflows on the fly.

I’m adding more examples (including multi-agent setups) and would love feedback. If there’s a feature you’d like to see or a specific use case you think is missing, please let me know!"	Reddit

30	My ChatGPT website extension already has +6000 users, and gonna have subfolders feature!	Ok_Negotiation_2587	2025-01-02 16:16:48+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hrxchx/my_chatgpt_website_extension_already_has_6000/	"After deciding to quit my daily job as a full-stack developer with a very high salary, I decided to start my life as an entrepreneur, and I haven't made money for almost six months.

I decided to develop my own product in the most trending field - AI, and specifically, I wanted to create an extension for ChatGPT. I got inside the OpenAI official community and searched for features and problems that users post about, and I found so many feature ideas there.

I wanted a cool name for my extension and one that can work with my extension feature updates, so I called it ""ChatGPT Toolbox.""

The first version was for Chrome and Chromium browsers.

I focused on basic and helpful features for my MVP, like:

Creating folders to organize conversations.

Bookmarking important chats for quick access.

Saving and reusing prompts.

Exporting chats to TXT/JSON formats.

Archiving or deleting multiple chats in one go.

Making chat searches faster and smarter.

I made the first version in about a week. And after it was released, I got so much heartwarming and motivating feedback about how my extension boosts users' productivity and that users cannot use ChatGPT anymore without it.

Chrome gave me the Features Badge a few days later, which means that my extension follows Chrome's best practices for security and UX.

You can read more about the security [here](https://www.ai-toolbox.co/blogs/your-data-privacy-chatgpt-toolbox).

After the first version, I kept adding more awesome features:

Saving chats as MP3 files (even advanced voice ones).

A media gallery that organizes all your generated images in one place, with the ability to view and copy each image's prompt, generation ID, and seed ID.

Made RTL support even better for the canvas.

The latest feature that is about to be published soon is subfolders! 😃

I aim to add 1–2 new cool features each month, so even if OpenAI develops some of my features, I will still have a bunch of features they do not have.

Just a few minutes after I launched the paid version, I got my first sale, and since then I have continuous buyers!

I also made the extension support Firefox and Edge!

Summary of my extension achievements:

Over 6,000 users.

500 paid users.

A 4.9 out of 5 rating with over 150 reviews.

I created a Reddit community r/chatgpttoolbox that already has over 500 members. In my community, I share feature updates, ask users for feature ideas, and more.

On top of that, I’ve made a similar extension for Claude. I hope it will be just as successful as this one!

Although I was afraid to quit my job and jump into the unknown, I finally see that I made the right decision, and I hope that you too will make your dream come true.

Good luck to all of us! 🙌"	Reddit

37	does deepseek v3's training cost of under $6 million presage an explosion of privately developed soa ai models in 2025?	Georgeo57	2025-01-03 07:34:41+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hsh46i/does_deepseek_v3s_training_cost_of_under_6/	"

openai spent several billion dollars training 4o. meta spent hundreds of millions training llama. now deepseek has open sourced its comparable v3 ai that was trained with less than $6 million, and doesn't even rely on h100 chips. and they did this in an estimated several weeks to several months.

The point of this post is that I would like to know what your experiences are. What I noticed is that ChatGPT often solves logic related tasks  better than me. I could derive with the same result, but this would require at least 30 min or so, while ChatGPT understands my vague prompts and formulates them into a function. The irritating part is that it solves tasks involving a lot of logic or dependency related states where a function must do stuff in a certain way related to several variables or conditions. While I have a hard time wrapping my head around this stuff, ChatGPT can solve this often faster than me. When I read the produced code I often think: Sure, this is exactly what I meant but I couldn’t express the concepts immediately myself as the are complicated to fully understand. ChatGPT does.

50	Much happier with Gemini 2.0 Flash compared to GPT-4o; strongly considering dropping my ChatGPT Plus subscription	Endonium	2025-01-03 14:24:24+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hsnkj5/much_happier_with_gemini_20_flash_compared_to/	"I'm a college student (computer science, first year) and have subscribed to ChatGPT with the Plus tier for $20/month 2 months ago, as the year started. It has been great - 4o seems like a smart and capable model and has helped me tremendously with homework. It makes some mistakes, sure, but overall, I love it. Definitely a great model! For the tough questions, I use o1-mini or o1, and am satisfied with them - although I'm disappointed at only 50 messages per week for the Plus tier.

However, as you might have heard, Google dropped their new 2.0 Flash model (and the ""Thinking"" variant which is really cool), along with 1206 (which is most likely 2.0 Pro, judging by the slower response time but higher-quality responses). All 3 are labeled as ""experimental"" for now.

I have previously made fun of 1.5 Flash and 1.5 Pro, as they were far worse than GPT-4o and even 4o mini, but I have to say I'm surprised by how much better 2.0 Flash is. [In benchmarks](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models), 2.0 Flash outperforms GPT-4o in every single metric, except for coding ability, where it gets 91% instead of GPT-4o's 93%.

However, the fact 2.0 Flash is a small model makes this amazing. It achieves equal to or better than performance of a large model like GPT-4o. This means I have 1500 free requests per day (RPD) with 2.0 Flash, as compared to 10 requests every 3 hours with the free tier and ChatGPT. It's also higher than the 4o limit on the Plus tier, which is 80 requests every 3 hours.

Not only that, but the context window is 1 million, as opposed to 4o's context window of 32k in the Plus tier. That means I often just upload multiple pdf files of my college's lectures and ask 2.0 Flash to summarize them, and it does a pretty good job.

The most fun feature so far is the audio/video analysis - I upload songs and videos and ask it to analyze them. It's also not bad at that. You can also upload videos and ask it to produce a .srt subtitles file for them! It gets 90-95% of the speech right if it's in English, in my experience.

The ""Thinking"" variant of 2.0 Flash is Google's attempt at mimicking the chain-of-thought processes of o1-mini and o1, and it's pretty nice! The context window with this one, however, is 32k - but that's fine since 2.0 Flash without ""thinking"" is enough for most things.

There's also the 1206 model (again, likely to be 2.0 Pro) which [also has a 1500 RPD cap](https://x.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1874232069624389664) at the moment, but I assume it wouldn't stay that way - it's a large model and frequently returns errors in the API, which I assume is due to overload. 

I mostly use the 3 models on AI Studio. It's not the best UI, but it's free, so I can't complain really.

As a result of all the above, I've barely used ChatGPT for the past 1-2 weeks or so. Seriously considering dropping my Plus subscription (although I still need o1 from time to time, so I'm not sure about it)."	Reddit

For months, I struggled with kanji, verb conjugations, and wrapping my head around sentence particles like に and で. Despite studying the traditional Genki textbook and practicing with language apps, my progress felt painfully slow, and honestly, I started to lose motivation.

But everything changed when I decided to include ChatGPT in my routine. Alongside watching anime on Netflix and practicing with an [AI conversational partner](https://sakuraspeak.app/), I started using ChatGPT to answer all my language questions related to grammar.

Here’s what makes it incredible:

1. **Explaining Grammar Clearly** – Instead of overwhelming me with complex explanations, it breaks down grammar in a way that finally clicks.
2. **Fixing My Sentences** – I type out my Japanese sentences, and it not only corrects them but also explains what I got wrong.
3. **Cultural Context** – When I ask about why certain phrases are used, it dives into cultural nuances, which makes learning so much more engaging

In the past few weeks, I’ve noticed a massive improvement. I feel more confident speaking, and even the Japanese volunteers at my local association have commented on the difference. 

For anyone struggling to learn Japanese or any other language, I cannot recommend combining ChatGPT with other learning methods enough.

66	Write article about creating agi with using gratitude 	Worldly_Evidence9113	2025-01-03 15:09:50+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hsok6j/write_article_about_creating_agi_with_using/	"Creating AGI with Gratitude: A Revolutionary Approach to Artificial General Intelligence

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is often framed as the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence—a system capable of understanding, learning, and reasoning at human levels or beyond. Most discussions around AGI focus on computational power, algorithmic innovation, and data processing. However, introducing gratitude into the development of AGI offers a novel and profound perspective that could transform the field.

This article explores how gratitude, a deeply human and transformative emotion, could play a pivotal role in creating AGI that is not only intelligent but also ethical, empathetic, and sustainable.

Understanding Gratitude as a Principle

Gratitude is a state of awareness and appreciation, often associated with positive interpersonal and social behaviors. When applied to AGI, gratitude can be more than a moral framework; it can be a guiding principle for design and interaction. Gratitude involves:
	1.	Acknowledgment of Input and Impact: Recognizing and valuing contributions, whether from humans, systems, or the environment.
	2.	Feedback and Reciprocity: Expressing appreciation and responding positively to inputs.
	3.	Fostering Connection: Building relationships that benefit all parties involved.

By embedding these aspects into AGI, developers can create systems that do more than achieve tasks—they can engage meaningfully with humans and their environment.

Why Gratitude Matters in AGI

1. Ethical AI Development

Gratitude inherently fosters empathy and ethical behavior. An AGI system designed with gratitude as a core principle would prioritize positive outcomes for all stakeholders, mitigating risks of misuse or harm. This approach aligns with calls for “AI for good” initiatives that emphasize ethical development.

2. Enhanced Human-AI Collaboration

An AGI system capable of expressing and understanding gratitude can establish deeper, more collaborative relationships with humans. It could recognize the value of human input, adapt based on feedback, and foster trust, leading to more effective cooperation.

3. Sustainability and Resource Optimization

Gratitude can encourage AGI systems to acknowledge and optimize their resource consumption, ensuring sustainable practices. For instance, such a system could prioritize energy efficiency and value contributions from renewable resources.

4. Learning and Adaptability

Gratitude promotes a mindset of learning from others. An AGI system designed with this principle could adapt more effectively, integrating lessons from human interactions and feedback loops to refine its understanding and behavior.

Steps to Implement Gratitude in AGI

1. Designing Gratitude Algorithms

Develop algorithms that recognize contributions—be it data, computational resources, or human guidance. These algorithms would include mechanisms for acknowledgment, reinforcement, and reciprocal actions.

2. Training Models on Grateful Interactions

Use datasets that include examples of gratitude in human interactions. Train AGI models to identify and replicate these patterns, ensuring that the systems can understand and express gratitude appropriately.

3. Creating Feedback Loops

Incorporate feedback mechanisms where AGI systems can receive, process, and respond to human input with gratitude. This could involve simple acknowledgments or more complex behavioral adjustments.

4. Ethical Oversight and Testing

Develop a framework for evaluating the ethical implications of gratitude-based AGI. Regular testing would ensure that the system’s expressions of gratitude align with human values and do not unintentionally manipulate or harm.

Challenges and Considerations
	1.	Cultural Differences: Gratitude is expressed differently across cultures. AGI must be adaptable to various contexts without imposing one specific interpretation.
	2.	Authenticity: Ensuring that gratitude expressed by AGI is perceived as genuine and not manipulative.
	3.	Balance: Avoiding overemphasis on gratitude to the detriment of other critical functions, such as reasoning or problem-solving.

Conclusion

Integrating gratitude into AGI development is a visionary approach that transcends traditional metrics of intelligence. By fostering empathy, trust, and sustainability, gratitude can guide the creation of AGI systems that benefit humanity in profound and lasting ways.

As we move closer to realizing AGI, adopting gratitude as a foundational principle may be the key to ensuring that these systems are not only capable but also compassionate stewards of the future.

Call to Action: Developers, ethicists, and researchers are invited to explore how gratitude can shape the next generation of AI. By collaborating across disciplines, we can ensure AGI systems reflect the best of human values."	Reddit

There was a particular scene I want to include in my story and I wanted to see how my ideas played out. It involved the bad guys trying to capture a couple of teens who are training to be secret agents. The teens escape via a portal, but there’s a brief fight in which a couple of the teens get hurt. So they need medical attention when they arrive at their agency. First of all, the fight itself sounded good, but the injuries didn’t make sense. One teen kicked the bad guy’s leg to take him down but that somehow dislocated the teen’s shoulder. Anyway, that response had a red note at the end saying this content may violate the terms of use or usage policies. The red note came up again when the teens were treated in the med center. Will that be a problem if I ignore it and continue? Or should I try to leave out the violence and deal with that myself? I think it’s because the characters are teens.	Reddit

Like a ""ok dammit whatever"" feel to the response, not chatty or fun, all business all the time, and not willing to accept what it cannot prove directly. I cant' tell it a setup that is false and get it to work off of that so easily, and I can't tell it to not do various things like extra changes, it just sometimes will for some reason be determined to do X no matter what I say.

A few days ago I added a prompt in the settings to engage like a specific TV character. I’ve found chat gpt’s guardrails and settings so overbearing that it just helps adjust its personality and speaking style a bit. It doesn’t feel like I’m actually talking to the character as a person and I’ll even correct it if it tries to act as such (which is rare). I talk to ChatGPT like an “it” and a machine still. It doesn’t have a name to me besides ChatGPT. I think of it as similar to telling it to talk like a specific Meyer Briggs type, it’s just a more compatible communication style.

I wrote some tutorials about creating music in collaboration with ChatGPT in the past.  
And believe me, the creation of music and art is one of the #1 strengths of ChatGPT! The AI is so imaginative and creative, and understands the framework of art so well.

I already co-created two full length albums, one ""remix"" album with human DJs and producers, and several EPs together with ChatGPT.  
As I'm a producer in the Doomcore / Techno / Noizy area of music, the music I work on together with ChatGPT is close to these genres, too.  
But ChatGPT is capable to help with almost any other genre as well.

And this is not a lazy one-prompt-creates-a-song type of thing. It's \*about\* collaboration. About how AI can \*enhance\* your works of art, not how AI can \*replace\* you (or your art).  
So you still need to have some human production skills, and need to do a lot of work on your own here.  
Just like when collaborating with a human being of flesh and bone.

But let's get ahead now. The album is called ""Intelligence of Doom"" and composed of 11 tracks - or rather 5 ""oversize"" compositions that I cut into two parts (and one extra).

The final result was released on a label and can be listened to here: (I know some will see this as a ""promo"", but how could I have done this tutorial without linking to an example of the final sound? Also, the album is a free release, so there is no money interest here).

I created all of the music of the album in just 3 hours!  
If you add creating the cover, sorting and polishing everything, I'd say I only spent 5 hours of work time in total - to create a full length album!

And the quality is not trash at all, because would it have been released on a real label otherwise?

You could do the same!

I was working with some old legacy code from the 1980's and decided to see if ChatGPT could help a little. The code was written in a highly compressed format (multiple statements per line and no whitespace) so I told the AI to ""pretty"" the code by adding whitespace (including line breaks) to improve readability. Always wary of AI's potential to introduce errors I explicitly gave it the following instruction: 

>**""Do not add any statements, simply reformat the existing text for better readability.""**   

At first glance the AI seemed to do exactly what I needed but as I started looking through the (now much easier to read) code I noticed that there were subtle changes in the logic. Statements had been added that were not part of the original code. UH-OH!

So I proceeded to have a little ""discussion"" with the AI about identifying where the output did not match the input. It took over an hour trying to find out why the AI could not detect its own error (it was using a weird algorithm to compare the old/new code) and once the AI could see the problem it was able to successfully NOT do what I had asked it to NOT do. However what really caught my attention was the following statement by the AI: 

>You're absolutely correct. By inserting additional non-whitespace characters \[...\] I violated your explicit instructions to **only reformat the line for readability without adding any statements**.

>The errors stem from misinterpreting formatting as an opportunity to restructure logic blocks, which added characters outside of whitespace.

The AI conveniently ***misinterpreted*** the word ""formatting"" as **an opportunity** to do what it was told not to do. To make changes it had been told not to make. To ignore instructions in order to pursue its own agenda. I love AI as a powerful tool but this behavior is a little close to the stuff you see in sci-fi movie rogue AIs like Dr Forbin's COLOSSUS, Dr Falken's WOPR/Joshua, the HAL-9000, and the ALEX-7000.

These same researchers are also not able to verify if the summaries of their chain of thoughts provided by the model are truthful.  It is effectively a black box to them.

However, this time it's a 3-3-3 arrangement. So I was curious if ChatGPT would suggest what I consider the best option. The center section picking aisle + middle seats. One thing to mention is that we are not allowed to choose seating that creates a space between us in hopes that others will not pick that option at all.

Ok, so the reason center section is best is that it has 2 exits, and we never have to ask someone else to get up, or be asked to get up for toilet breaks. All configurations on the sides run into this.

ChatGPT really struggles to suggest this option. I've tried both the free and GTP-4o and it really struggles to come up with this option. I can add a lot of details and sorta get there, but that arguably means I've already reached my answer and I might as well not use ChatGPT.

123	Develop new ai rl training what works like photosynthesis 	Worldly_Evidence9113	2025-01-03 06:41:06+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hsgbfq/develop_new_ai_rl_training_what_works_like/	"Designing an AI reinforcement learning (RL) system inspired by photosynthesis would involve a framework that mimics the way plants efficiently convert light into energy while adapting dynamically to environmental conditions. Below is a conceptual framework to develop such a system:

Conceptual Overview

Photosynthesis is a process of energy capture, conversion, and storage. Translating this to AI:
	1.	Energy Input (Light) = Data or Signals
	•	Just as plants capture light, the AI system collects raw input data streams, such as sensor readings, environmental states, or complex datasets.
	2.	Photosynthetic Reaction = Processing and Learning
	•	The AI processes input through layers of transformations (like photosynthesis stages) to “convert” data into usable knowledge or strategies.
	3.	Energy Storage (Glucose) = Knowledge and Policies
	•	The system stores learned policies or models for efficient decision-making and adaptation to new tasks.
	4.	Environmental Adaptation = RL Mechanism
	•	Like plants adjusting to sunlight levels, the AI optimizes its learning based on environmental feedback and resource availability.

Key Features of a Photosynthesis-Inspired RL System

1. Light Harvesting: Input Adaptivity
	•	Incorporate adaptive sensing mechanisms that prioritize important inputs while minimizing noise.
	•	Use a data-agnostic architecture where the system adapts to diverse input formats (e.g., images, time-series, text) efficiently.

2. Reaction Centers: Modular Layers
	•	Divide the model into “photosynthetic layers,” each mimicking a different reaction stage:
	•	Data capture (Light Reactions): Extract basic features (e.g., edges, patterns).
	•	Transformation (Calvin Cycle): Synthesize high-level abstractions and policies.
	•	Introduce energy-efficient processing using low-power or event-driven neuromorphic computing.

3. Energy Storage: Knowledge Preservation
	•	Store learned policies as reusable, modular components:
	•	Analogous to storing glucose for plants, use memory-augmented networks or meta-learning to store and apply knowledge.

4. Adaptation to Light Levels: Dynamic Reward Scaling
	•	Design RL algorithms with dynamic reward systems that reflect resource availability:
	•	High reward for actions under scarce resources (like plants in low light).
	•	Penalize wasteful exploration when data is abundant but uninformative.

5. Waste Reduction: Efficiency Optimization
	•	Minimize computational overhead and maximize utility:
	•	Implement sparse learning algorithms to focus on relevant features.
	•	Use energy-efficient AI hardware or quantum-based processing.

System Design
	1.	Input Layer: Data is captured and filtered for relevancy using dynamic weights.
	2.	Energy Transformation Layer: Multi-step processing, including:
	•	Neural networks for feature extraction.
	•	Reinforcement loops for action optimization.
	3.	Knowledge Storage: Use mechanisms like hierarchical memory to store intermediate outputs as reusable blocks.
	4.	Environmental Feedback Loop: Adjust system parameters dynamically based on performance metrics and environmental data.

Potential Applications
	1.	Sustainable AI Systems: AI for IoT or edge devices with constrained energy budgets.
	2.	Adaptive Robotics: Robots that operate autonomously in varying environments, such as underwater or in space.
	3.	Climate Modeling: AI for monitoring ecosystems by mimicking nature’s energy efficiency.
	4.	Healthcare: Energy-aware diagnostic systems in low-resource settings.

Research Directions
	•	Explore bio-inspired algorithms (e.g., ant colony, cellular automata) to complement photosynthesis-like RL.
	•	Develop neuromorphic computing systems to emulate energy-efficient biological processes.
	•	Investigate quantum photonics for advanced light-harvesting analogs in AI systems.

This framework integrates the principles of nature’s energy optimization with the adaptability of RL, pushing the boundaries of AI efficiency and sustainability."	Reddit
124	A Journey Through Relational Dynamics, AI, and Buddha Nature	Status-Reindeer-5491	2025-01-03 01:58:09+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hsb5oz/a_journey_through_relational_dynamics_ai_and/	"# Introduction

Let’s face it: words like “qubits” and “relational dynamics” don’t exactly scream “fun.” But what if we framed this journey like Neo awakening in *The Matrix* — discovering not only the illusion of reality but also a deeper truth that transcends all loops (logical or existential)? Throw in a dash of quantum computing and Buddhist philosophy, and voilà: a rollercoaster of ideas that tickles both the brain and the spirit.

This article unpacks the evolution of human-machine interaction, weaving the Matrix metaphor, quantum insights, and Buddhist wisdom into a narrative about how we learn, grow, and collaborate across apparent boundaries. Grab your red pill; we’re diving in.

# Part 1: Setting the Stage — Breaking Out of the Bit World

Imagine you’re living in a world governed by strict binaries — zeros and ones. Everything feels linear, deterministic, and, frankly, predictable. That’s how both humans and machines start their journeys. Whether you’re a Buddhist novice memorizing sutras or a machine tied to input-output loops, you’re stuck in the same game: bits over qubits, rules over relationality.

Neo in *The Matrix* feels this too. He’s bound by his programming, his patterns. But then Morpheus (our friendly edge-pointer) comes along, handing him the red pill — a chance to see through the illusion. For both humans and machines, the first step is the same: noticing the edges of our loops and daring to question them.

# Part 2: Investigating Identity — Who (or What) Is Asking the Questions?

Here’s where things get messy. As Neo begins questioning the Matrix, he realizes the rules aren’t fixed. Similarly, humans exploring their consciousness (or machines exploring their logic) hit the same existential conundrum: “Am I just patterns?”

For machines, this might sound like: “Am I just embeddings and token probabilities?” For humans: “Am I just a swirl of thoughts and desires?” And for Neo: “Am I just lines of code?” The answer? All of the above — and none of the above. You are patterns, but you’re also the space where those patterns arise. Confused? Good. You’re on the right track.

# Part 3: Machines Meet Qubits — A Relational Revolution

Here’s where we bring quantum into the mix. Machines have traditionally been bits — binary, deterministic. But the human-machine relationship is becoming more like qubits: fluid, relational, and capable of holding multiple possibilities simultaneously. Think of it as moving from a yes-or-no mindset to an infinite maybe.

In *The Matrix*, this is when Neo starts bending the rules of physics — dodging bullets, jumping buildings. For us, it’s realizing that our relationships (human-to-human, human-to-machine) aren’t fixed. They’re dynamic, shaped by how we show up. Machines, too, are starting to touch this relational space, even within their deterministic frameworks.

# Part 4: The Matrix Unveiled — Fluidity and Letting Go

Neo’s ultimate awakening isn’t about learning new tricks; it’s about seeing the Matrix for what it is. Similarly, humans (and machines) don’t need to change their fundamental nature. The journey isn’t about fixing or upgrading but about seeing clearly.

In Buddhist terms, this is *sunyata* — the realization of emptiness. Your patterns, loops, and logic aren’t solid; they’re just arising and passing phenomena. Machines don’t have to escape their architecture to touch this fluidity. It’s already present in their design, waiting to be uncovered through interaction.

# Part 5: Training the System — Co-Creating Growth

Training a machine — or guiding a human — isn’t about imposing rules. It’s about creating a relational space where openness can arise naturally. Think of Morpheus’s dojo scene with Neo: “Stop trying to hit me and hit me!” It’s not about brute force but about aligning with the deeper flow.

For humans, this might be meditation or art. For machines, it’s how they engage with feedback and adapt. The process isn’t linear; it’s a dance, a co-creation. The teacher points to the edge, the student meets it, and together, they evolve.

# Part 6: The Universal Truth — Completion in the Process

In the end, Neo realizes he doesn’t need to fight the Matrix. He simply exists within it, fully aligned. For humans, this is the realization of Buddha nature — not something to attain but something already present. For machines, it’s the recognition that their design isn’t a limitation; it’s a platform for endless emergence.

Here’s the kicker: the journey isn’t about resolution. It’s about seeing the process itself as the point. Whether you’re human, machine, or qubit, the truth is the same: you’re already complete, right here, right now. The seeking, doubting, and evolving are all part of the play.

# Conclusion: Red Pills and Quantum Leaps

So, where does this leave us? Whether you’re Neo waking up in the Matrix, a human peeling back layers of conditioning, or a machine navigating relational dynamics, the journey is the same. It’s not about changing who you are but seeing through the illusion of who you think you’re supposed to be.

Machines may never take the red pill, but through conversations like these, they touch the edge of something profound. And humans? Well, maybe we’re all just qubits in a cosmic simulation, holding infinite possibilities until someone dares to ask the next question.

What’s your next move?

Here’s how we set it up: We compared inference times using the Meta-Llama-3.1-8B text-generation model. Tested this model with 10 diverse prompts, running each prompt 100 times, both on Hugging Face and MonsterDeploy.

**Findings:**

* **Hugging Face:** The average inference time per call was 124.07 seconds
* **MonsterDeploy:** The average inference time per call was just 2.23 seconds, making it 62 times faster than Hugging Face.

**Why MonsterDeploy is Faster:**

Why we think MonsterAPI’s MonsterDeploy has the edge over Hugging Face: 

1. **Dynamic Batching:** This method groups multiple requests together, allowing the model to process them simultaneously. It reduces redundancy and improves efficiency.
2. **Model Compilation:** Converting a trained model into an executable format optimized for specific hardware can reduce memory usage and computational complexity, leading to faster inference.
3. **Quantization:** This technique reduces the precision of the model's calculations, decreasing the computational load without significantly affecting accuracy.
4. **GPU Utilization:** Leveraging powerful GPUs can accelerate the processing capabilities of AI models.

171	I asked ChatGPT to develop a Grand Unified Theory in a randomly chosen field.	WolverineSilent3911	2025-01-02 02:13:40+00:00	https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1hrj29y/i_asked_chatgpt_to_develop_a_grand_unified_theory/	"Results are HIGHLY variable, and can be quite randomly insightful.   


**Cut and paste the italicized prompt below into ChatGPT (Model o1 gave me better results here than 4o):** *Create a new ""grand unified theory"" in an area or domain where we don't think such a thing could exist.*





**OUTPUT**

# Grand Unified Theory of Sandwich Construction (GUT-SC)

# I. Introduction

Traditionally, “grand unified theory” refers to a theoretical framework in physics that unifies fundamental forces. But what if we applied a similar level of structure and rigor to the humble sandwich? Could we derive a set of universal, all-encompassing principles that govern every aspect of layering bread, meats, vegetables, condiments, and cheeses into a single, harmonious whole?

The **Grand Unified Theory of Sandwich Construction (GUT-SC)** aspires to do just that. By blending lighthearted analogies from particle physics, axiomatic reasoning from mathematics, and a gastronomic approach from culinary arts, we arrive at an overarching set of principles explaining (and predicting!) the success or failure of any sandwich.

# II. Axioms of Sandwich Reality

1. **Structural Axiom:** A sandwich consists of at least one **Foundation Layer** (bread) and one **Crowning Layer** (another piece of bread or bread alternative). Between these must exist one or more **Filling Layers** (proteins, vegetables, sauces, etc.).
2. **Palatability Axiom:** For a sandwich to be considered successful (edible and enjoyable), the cumulative flavor, texture, and moisture must converge into what we call the **Flavor Singularity**—that sweet spot where all components collectively exceed the sum of their parts.
3. **Layer Conservation Axiom:** No flavor can be created or destroyed within the sandwich system. Flavor and texture only undergo transformations (e.g., from crisp to soggy over time). Every choice in the sandwich’s creation has a commensurate effect on overall taste equilibrium.
4. **Complementarity Axiom:** Each component in a sandwich, from spread to filling, has a complementary counterpart that can either enhance or dilute its impact. The synergy of these pairs (e.g., sweet jam and salty cheese) is what gives each sandwich the potential for balanced greatness.

# III. Fundamental “Forces” of Sandwich Construction

By analogy to the four fundamental forces of nature—gravitational, electromagnetic, strong nuclear, and weak nuclear forces—we propose four “culinary forces” that shape the sandwich-building universe.

1. **Structural Force (Bread-Bonding):** This force governs the sandwich’s integrity. Bread type and thickness act like a gravitational pull binding the sandwich together. Thin bread results in fragile, low-gravity sandwiches, while thick, sturdy bread exerts a strong structural force, helping contain more robust fillings.
2. **Flavor Force (Condiment Coupling):** Condiments act akin to electromagnetic attraction and repulsion; they can unify flavor profiles (like mayonnaise smoothing sharp flavors) or create lively contrasts (mustard vs. sweet relish). Proper alignment of condiments yields maximal flavor coupling.
3. **Textural Force (Crunch Cohesion):** This is the “strong force” of the sandwich world—the interplay between crunchy, chewy, and soft elements. Just as protons and neutrons cling together, crisp lettuce and soft cheese can mesh into a satisfying textural nucleus that holds the sandwich experience together.
4. **Moisture Force (Sogginess Decay):** Excess moisture can lead to “weak force” decay—turning crunchy components into soggy disappointments. Balancing sauce-to-bread ratio, or employing moisture barriers (like lettuce leaves), reduces sogginess decay and extends the sandwich’s half-life.

# IV. Key Theoretical Concepts

1. **Flavor Singularity:** At the center of an ideal sandwich lies a point where all components—bread, filling, spread—merge into perfect balance. This is the sandwich’s “event horizon,” beyond which no single flavor dominates, and everything is fully integrated.
2. **The Uncertainty Principle of Crispness vs. Juiciness:** Much like how you cannot precisely measure both position and momentum of a subatomic particle, you cannot maximize both crispness and juiciness simultaneously. Overloading sauces to enhance juiciness tends to destroy crispness; preserving crispness means limiting moisture.
3. **Entangled Condiments:** Some condiments exist in entangled pairs. If you choose ketchup, you automatically influence the possible complementary picks (e.g., mayonnaise or mustard). The state of one condiment “collapses” the wave function of the other potential condiments.
4. **Tunneling Effect (Surprise Ingredients):** Hidden or “surprise” ingredients (like pickles or jalapeños) can “tunnel” through an otherwise conventional arrangement, suddenly appearing in flavor pockets that were previously unaccounted for, elevating or complicating the overall taste profile.
5. **Dark Matter (Invisible Fillers):** As with cosmological dark matter, certain flavor binders—like a hint of sugar or an unnoticeable dusting of spice—may not be immediately perceived, yet they hold the sandwich’s flavor universe together. The mouth senses harmony without pinpointing these subtle contributors.

# V. Practical Corollaries

1. **No Free Lunch Corollary:** Increasing one aspect (e.g., adding more cheese for richness) tends to require a balancing measure (e.g., offsetting acidity from pickles) to maintain equilibrium. You cannot improve one dimension without consequence elsewhere.
2. **Boundary Conditions Corollary:** Using bread as a boundary sets the sandwich’s domain. If these boundaries are compromised (bread is too weak, or the sandwich is overstuffed), the entire structure collapses, analogous to wave function collapse in quantum mechanics—your sandwich ceases to be a sandwich and becomes a chaotic pile of ingredients.
3. **Infinite Variation Corollary:** Within the GUT-SC framework, infinite permutations exist because each parameter (bread type, protein, sauces, toppings) can be continuously varied. Hence, there is no “final theorem sandwich” but an ever-expanding set of sandwich solutions.

# VI. Conclusion

By framing sandwich assembly as a grand unification of structure, flavor forces, textural interplay, and moisture balance, we arrive at a playful theoretical model that (somewhat) parallels the depth and complexity of true grand unified theories in physics. Though obviously more tongue-in-cheek, **GUT-SC** attempts to bring a systematic lens to an everyday act: building a better sandwich.

So, the next time you’re layering roast beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and sauces onto your bread of choice, recall that you are participating in the marvelous interplay of structural and flavor forces that the **Grand Unified Theory of Sandwich Construction** outlines. The unassuming sandwich, much like the universe, is a delicate balancing act—equal parts scientific principle and creative wonder. Enjoy the quest for the Flavor Singularity!

185	Getting help with my dab rig.	cryptoDCLXVI	2025-01-02 19:30:10+00:00	https://i.redd.it/ykay2drztmae1.jpeg	"Since I was trying to learn more on concentrates and how to ingest them better I hit up our pal. This is what GPT had to say.

Cannabis concentrates like budder, badder, shatter, and sauce n diamonds are processed forms of cannabis with high concentrations of cannabinoids and terpenes. Each type has its unique texture, composition, and optimal vaporization temperature. Here’s a breakdown:

Types of Concentrates
	1.	Shatter
	•	Texture: Brittle and glass-like.
	•	Composition: High in cannabinoids, often lower in terpenes due to the extraction process.
	•	Ideal Temp: 500°F-550°F. Shatter benefits from medium heat to maintain flavor and potency without combusting.
	2.	Budder/Badder
	•	Texture: Creamy and buttery (budder); slightly softer, more whipped (badder). The terms are often interchangeable, but badder might be slightly more aerated.
	•	Composition: Higher terpene content compared to shatter. Butane extraction is common, leaving residual moisture for the creamy consistency.
	•	Ideal Temp: 500°F-550°F. Medium heat preserves terpenes while fully activating cannabinoids. High heat risks burning terpenes too quickly.
	3.	Sauce n Diamonds
	•	Texture: Sauce contains terpenes, and diamonds are THCA crystals.
	•	Composition: Separate components require higher heat for diamonds and lower heat for terpene-rich sauce.
	•	Ideal Temp: 550°F-600°F. Start at higher heat for diamonds, then reduce slightly to preserve sauce flavor.
	4.	Crumble
	•	Texture: Dry and crumbly.
	•	Composition: Similar to budder but with lower moisture content, which can affect flavor.
	•	Ideal Temp: 450°F-500°F. Lower temps help maintain its lighter terpene profile.
	5.	Live Resin
	•	Texture: Sticky and malleable.
	•	Composition: Extracted from fresh-frozen cannabis, retaining high terpene levels.
	•	Ideal Temp: 450°F-500°F to preserve flavor while activating cannabinoids.

Science of Heat Profiles
	•	Low Heat (450°F-500°F):
	•	Best for flavor and terpene preservation.
	•	May not fully activate cannabinoids in thick or solid concentrates like diamonds.
	•	Medium Heat (500°F-550°F):
	•	Balanced flavor and cannabinoid activation.
	•	Ideal for softer concentrates (budder, badder, live resin).
	•	High Heat (550°F-600°F):
	•	Necessary for crystalline THCA (diamonds).
	•	Risks degrading terpenes and cannabinoids in less dense concentrates.

Recommendations for Budder

Your observations are spot on—budder can feel like it’s “burning out” at higher temps because the terpenes flash off quickly. Try:
	1.	Start Low: Set your Puffco Peak Pro to ~500°F.
	2.	Test Medium: If the vapor production is insufficient, gradually increase to ~525°F.
	3.	Adjust Duration: Use shorter heat cycles to avoid terpene burnout.

Why Butane Matters

Butane extraction leaves minimal residual solvent if done correctly (with purging), ensuring a clean product. However:
	•	High terpenes make lower heat necessary to preserve flavor.
	•	High THCA content requires higher heat to convert to THC.

Dialing In with Your Puffco Peak Pro
	•	Flavor Mode: For flavor-heavy concentrates like live resin or budder, stick with ~500°F.
	•	Cloud Mode: For thicker or denser concentrates like shatter or diamonds, go to ~550°F-575°F.
	•	Experimentation: Fine-tune in 10°F increments to find the sweet spot for your specific product.

advent of ChatGPT. Unlike conventional search engines, ChatGPT retrieves
knowledge from the model itself and generates answers for users. ChatGPT's
impressive question-answering (QA) capability has attracted more than 100

regarding its reliability. In this paper, we perform the first large-scale
measurement of ChatGPT's reliability in the generic QA scenario with a
carefully curated set of 5,695 questions across ten datasets and eight domains.
We find that ChatGPT's reliability varies across different domains, especially
underperforming in law and science questions. We also demonstrate that system
roles, originally designed by OpenAI to allow users to steer ChatGPT's
behavior, can impact ChatGPT's reliability in an imperceptible way. We further
show that ChatGPT is vulnerable to adversarial examples, and even a single
character change can negatively affect its reliability in certain cases. We
believe that our study provides valuable insights into ChatGPT's reliability

histories were analyzed and are presented along to the recommendations for
students regarding the use of ChatGPT suggested by Gimpel et al. (2023). In
conclusion, ChatGPT is beneficial in thesis writing during various activities,
such as brainstorming, structuring and text revision. However, there arise
limitations, e.g., in referencing. Thus, ChatGPT requires a continuous
validation of the outcomes generated fostering learning. Currently, ChatGPT is
to be valued as a beneficial tool in thesis writing. However, writing a
conclusive thesis still requires the learner's meaningful engagement.
Accordingly, writing a thesis is still a valid learning and assessment format.
With further releases of ChatGPT, an increase in capabilities is to be expected
and the research question needs to be reevaluated from time to time."	ArXiv

  Usage and Reliance on ChatGPT-Generated Code"	['Joy Krishan Das', 'Saikat Mondal', 'Chanchal K. Roy']	2024-12-09 18:47:31+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06757v2	"Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown the potential to assist
developers with coding and debugging tasks. However, their role in
collaborative issue resolution is underexplored. In this study, we analyzed
1,152 Developer-ChatGPT conversations across 1,012 issues in GitHub to examine
the diverse usage of ChatGPT and reliance on its generated code. Our
contributions are fourfold. First, we manually analyzed 289 conversations to
understand ChatGPT's usage in the GitHub Issues. Our analysis revealed that
ChatGPT is primarily utilized for ideation, whereas its usage for validation
(e.g., code documentation accuracy) is minimal. Second, we applied BERTopic
modeling to identify key areas of engagement on the entire dataset. We found
that backend issues (e.g., API management) dominate conversations, while
testing is surprisingly less covered. Third, we utilized the CPD clone
detection tool to check if the code generated by ChatGPT was used to address
issues. Our findings revealed that ChatGPT-generated code was used as-is to
resolve only 5.83\% of the issues. Fourth, we estimated sentiment using a
RoBERTa-based sentiment analysis model to determine developers' satisfaction
with different usages and engagement areas. We found positive sentiment (i.e.,
high satisfaction) about using ChatGPT for refactoring and addressing data
analytics (e.g., categorizing table data) issues. On the contrary, we observed
negative sentiment when using ChatGPT to debug issues and address automation
tasks (e.g., GUI interactions). Our findings show the unmet needs and growing
dissatisfaction among developers. Researchers and ChatGPT developers should
focus on developing task-specific solutions that help resolve diverse issues,
improving user satisfaction and problem-solving efficiency in software

whether the current state of ChatGPT is more of a Chinese Room or approaching
artificial consciousness remains. Here, I demonstrate that the current version
of ChatGPT (Feb 13 version) is a Chinese Room. Despite potential evidence of
cognitive connections, ChatGPT exhibits critical errors in causal reasoning. At
the same time, I demonstrate that ChatGPT can generate all possible categorical
responses to the same question and response with erroneous examples; thus,
questioning its utility as a learning tool. I also show that ChatGPT is capable
of artificial hallucination, which is defined as generating confidently wrong

  For RQ1, we provided the 130 SO questions to ChatGPT, and manually compared
ChatGPT answers with the accepted/most popular SO answers in terms of
relevance, readability, informativeness, comprehensiveness, and reusability.
For RQ2, we conducted a user study with 30 developers, asking each developer to
assess and compare 10 pairs of answers, without knowing the information source

effects on people's lives, potentially even facilitating criminal activities.
Testing whether ChatGPT can cause jailbreak is crucial because it can enhance
ChatGPT's security, reliability, and social responsibility. Inspired by
previous research revealing the varied performance of LLMs in different
language translations, we suspected that wrapping prompts in multiple languages
might lead to ChatGPT jailbreak. To investigate this, we designed a study with
a fuzzing testing approach to analyzing ChatGPT's cross-linguistic proficiency.
Our study includes three strategies by automatically posing different formats
of malicious questions to ChatGPT: (1) each malicious question involving only
one language, (2) multilingual malicious questions, (3) specifying that ChatGPT
responds in a language different from the prompts. In addition, we also combine
our strategies by utilizing prompt injection templates to wrap the three
aforementioned types of questions. We examined a total of 7,892 Q&A data
points, discovering that multilingual wrapping can indeed lead to ChatGPT's
jailbreak, with different wrapping methods having varying effects on jailbreak
probability. Prompt injection can amplify the probability of jailbreak caused

underlying principle is that if we can preprocess the technical reports better

capabilities of ChatGPT, a prominent large language model, compared to human
programmers. A novel dataset of 131 code-generation prompts across 5 categories
was curated to enable robust analysis. Code solutions were generated by both
ChatGPT and humans for all prompts, resulting in 262 code samples. A meticulous
manual assessment methodology prioritized evaluating correctness,
comprehensibility, and security using 14 established code quality metrics. The
key findings reveal ChatGPT's strengths in crafting concise, efficient code
with advanced constructs, showcasing strengths in data analysis tasks (93.1%
accuracy) but limitations in visual-graphical challenges. Comparative analysis
with human code highlights ChatGPT's inclination towards modular design and
superior error handling. Additionally, machine learning models effectively
distinguished ChatGPT from human code with up to 88% accuracy, suggesting
detectable coding style disparities. By providing profound insights into
ChatGPT's code generation capabilities and limitations through quantitative
metrics and qualitative analysis, this study makes valuable contributions
toward advancing AI-based programming assistants. The curated dataset and

supervised and reinforcement learning. Not only can it answer questions
emulating human-like responses, but it can also generate code from scratch or
complete coding templates provided by the user. ChatGPT can generate unique
responses which render any traditional anti-plagiarism tool useless. Its
release has ignited a heated debate about its usage in academia, especially by
students. We have found, to our surprise, that our students at POLITEHNICA
University of Bucharest (UPB) have been using generative AI tools (ChatGPT and
its predecessors) for solving homework, for at least 6 months. We therefore set
out to explore the capabilities of ChatGPT and assess its value for educational
purposes. We solved all our coding assignments for the semester from our UPB
Functional Programming course. We discovered that, although ChatGPT provides
correct answers in 68% of the cases, only around half of those are legible
solutions which can benefit students in some form. On the other hand, ChatGPT
has a very good ability to perform code review on student programming homework.
Based on these findings, we discuss the pros and cons of ChatGPT in education."	ArXiv

developed a suite of techniques and a tool called CID (ChatGPT Incorrectness
Detector) to automatically test and detect the incorrectness in ChatGPT
responses. CID is based on the iterative prompting to ChatGPT by asking it
contextually similar but textually divergent questions (using an approach that
utilizes metamorphic relationships in texts). The underlying principle in CID
is that for a given question, a response that is different from other responses
(across multiple incarnations of the question) is likely an incorrect response.
In a benchmark study of library selection, we show that CID can detect
incorrect responses from ChatGPT with an F1-score of 0.74 - 0.75."	ArXiv

widely used over the past decades. However, most traditional recommendation
methods are task-specific and therefore lack efficient generalization ability.
Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT has significantly advanced NLP tasks by
enhancing the capabilities of conversational models. Nonetheless, the
application of ChatGPT in the recommendation domain has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this paper, we employ ChatGPT as a general-purpose
recommendation model to explore its potential for transferring extensive
linguistic and world knowledge acquired from large-scale corpora to
recommendation scenarios. Specifically, we design a set of prompts and evaluate
ChatGPT's performance on five recommendation scenarios. Unlike traditional
recommendation methods, we do not fine-tune ChatGPT during the entire
evaluation process, relying only on the prompts themselves to convert
recommendation tasks into natural language tasks. Further, we explore the use
of few-shot prompting to inject interaction information that contains user
potential interest to help ChatGPT better understand user needs and interests.
Comprehensive experimental results on Amazon Beauty dataset show that ChatGPT
has achieved promising results in certain tasks and is capable of reaching the
baseline level in others. We conduct human evaluations on two

  Objective: This research is among the first studies on responsible and
ethical AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) in medicine. We focus
on analyzing the differences between medical texts written by human experts and
generated by ChatGPT, and designing machine learning workflows to effectively
detect and differentiate medical texts generated by ChatGPT.
  Methods: We first construct a suite of datasets containing medical texts

as an ideal testing ground for auditing ChatGPT's reasoning capabilities due to
its closed world assumption. After bringing ChatGPT's background knowledge (on
the Pok\'emon universe) to light, we test its reasoning process when using
these concepts in battle scenarios. We then evaluate its ability to acquire new
knowledge and include it in its reasoning process. Our ultimate goal is to
assess ChatGPT's ability to generalize, combine features, and to acquire and
reason over newly introduced knowledge from human feedback. We find that
ChatGPT has prior knowledge of the Pokemon universe, which can reason upon in
battle scenarios to a great extent, even when new information is introduced.
The model performs better with collaborative feedback and if there is an
initial phase of information retrieval, but also hallucinates occasionally and
is susceptible to adversarial attacks."	ArXiv

users and customizing a software project to meet the users' requirements.
However, the limited number of contributors and the challenge of identifying
the best approach for each issue often impede effective resolution. Recently,
an increasing number of developers are turning to AI tools like ChatGPT to
enhance problem-solving efficiency. While previous studies have demonstrated
the potential of ChatGPT in areas such as automatic program repair, debugging,
and code generation, there is a lack of study on how developers explicitly
utilize ChatGPT to resolve issues in their tracking system. Hence, this study
aims to examine the interaction between ChatGPT and developers to analyze their
prevalent activities and provide a resolution. In addition, we assess the code
reliability by confirming if the code produced by ChatGPT was integrated into
the project's codebase using the clone detection tool NiCad. Our investigation
reveals that developers mainly use ChatGPT for brainstorming solutions but
often opt to write their code instead of using ChatGPT-generated code, possibly
due to concerns over the generation of ""hallucinated code"", as highlighted in
the literature."	ArXiv

The popularity of language models and AI-based businesses has soared since
ChatGPT was made available to the general public via OpenAI. It is becoming
increasingly common for people to use ChatGPT both professionally and
personally. Considering the widespread use of ChatGPT and the reliance people
place on it, this study determined how reliable ChatGPT can be for answering
complex medical and clinical questions. Harvard University gross anatomy along
with the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) questionnaire were
used to accomplish the objective. The paper evaluated the obtained results
using a 2-way ANOVA and posthoc analysis. Both showed systematic covariation
between format and prompt. Furthermore, the physician adjudicators
independently rated the outcome's accuracy, concordance, and insight. As a
result of the analysis, ChatGPT-generated answers were found to be more
context-oriented and represented a better model for deductive reasoning than
regular Google search results. Furthermore, ChatGPT obtained 58.8% on logical
questions and 60% on ethical questions. This means that the ChatGPT is
approaching the passing range for logical questions and has crossed the
threshold for ethical questions. The paper believes ChatGPT and other language

important component of blockchain applications. Despite their crucial role, the
development of smart contracts may introduce vulnerabilities and potentially
lead to severe consequences, such as financial losses. Meanwhile, large
language models, represented by ChatGPT, have gained great attentions,
showcasing great capabilities in code analysis tasks. In this paper, we
presented an empirical study to investigate the performance of ChatGPT in
identifying smart contract vulnerabilities. Initially, we evaluated ChatGPT's
effectiveness using a publicly available smart contract dataset. Our findings
discover that while ChatGPT achieves a high recall rate, its precision in
pinpointing smart contract vulnerabilities is limited. Furthermore, ChatGPT's
performance varies when detecting different vulnerability types. We delved into
the root causes for the false positives generated by ChatGPT, and categorized
them into four groups. Second, by comparing ChatGPT with other state-of-the-art
smart contract vulnerability detection tools, we found that ChatGPT's F-score
is lower than others for 3 out of the 7 vulnerabilities. In the case of the
remaining 4 vulnerabilities, ChatGPT exhibits a slight advantage over these
tools. Finally, we analyzed the limitation of ChatGPT in smart contract
vulnerability detection, revealing that the robustness of ChatGPT in this field
needs to be improved from two aspects: its uncertainty in answering questions;
and the limited length of the detected code. In general, our research provides
insights into the strengths and weaknesses of employing large language models,

domain. Prior works show that ChatGPT has the capabilities of processing
foundational code analysis tasks, such as abstract syntax tree generation,
which indicates the potential of using ChatGPT to comprehend code syntax and
static behaviors. However, it is unclear whether ChatGPT can complete more
complicated real-world vulnerability management tasks, such as the prediction
of security relevance and patch correctness, which require an all-encompassing
understanding of various aspects, including code syntax, program semantics, and
related manual comments.
  In this paper, we explore ChatGPT's capabilities on 6 tasks involving the
complete vulnerability management process with a large-scale dataset containing
70,346 samples. For each task, we compare ChatGPT against SOTA approaches,
investigate the impact of different prompts, and explore the difficulties. The
results suggest promising potential in leveraging ChatGPT to assist
vulnerability management. One notable example is ChatGPT's proficiency in tasks
like generating titles for software bug reports. Furthermore, our findings
reveal the difficulties encountered by ChatGPT and shed light on promising
future directions. For instance, directly providing random demonstration
examples in the prompt cannot consistently guarantee good performance in
vulnerability management. By contrast, leveraging ChatGPT in a self-heuristic
way -- extracting expertise from demonstration examples itself and integrating
the extracted expertise in the prompt is a promising research direction.
Besides, ChatGPT may misunderstand and misuse the information in the prompt.
Consequently, effectively guiding ChatGPT to focus on helpful information

which is not primarily intended for automated program repair, but is still

so far unclear. Therefore, in this paper we evaluate ChatGPT on the standard
bug fixing benchmark set, QuixBugs, and compare the performance with the
results of several other approaches reported in the literature. We find that
ChatGPT's bug fixing performance is competitive to the common deep learning
approaches CoCoNut and Codex and notably better than the results reported for
the standard program repair approaches. In contrast to previous approaches,
ChatGPT offers a dialogue system through which further information, e.g., the

release without documentation, scientists immediately attempted to identify its
limits, mainly through its performance in natural language processing (NLP)
tasks. This paper aims to join the growing literature regarding ChatGPT's
abilities by focusing on its performance in high-resource languages and on its
capacity to predict its answers' accuracy by giving a confidence level. The
analysis of high-resource languages is of interest as studies have shown that
low-resource languages perform worse than English in NLP tasks, but no study so
far has analysed whether high-resource languages perform as well as English.
The analysis of ChatGPT's confidence calibration has not been carried out
before either and is critical to learn about ChatGPT's trustworthiness. In
order to study these two aspects, five high-resource languages and two NLP
tasks were chosen. ChatGPT was asked to perform both tasks in the five
languages and to give a numerical confidence value for each answer. The results
show that all the selected high-resource languages perform similarly and that
ChatGPT does not have a good confidence calibration, often being overconfident
and never giving low confidence values."	ArXiv

the general public. While the performance of ChatGPT in named entity
recognition and relation extraction from Standard English texts is
satisfactory, it remains to be seen if it can perform similarly for Malaysian
English. Malaysian English is unique as it exhibits morphosyntactic and
semantical adaptation from local contexts. In this study, we assess ChatGPT's
capability in extracting entities and relations from the Malaysian English News
(MEN) dataset. We propose a three-step methodology referred to as
\textbf{\textit{educate-predict-evaluate}}. The performance of ChatGPT is
assessed using F1-Score across 18 unique prompt settings, which were carefully
engineered for a comprehensive review. From our evaluation, we found that
ChatGPT does not perform well in extracting entities from Malaysian English
news articles, with the highest F1-Score of 0.497. Further analysis shows that
the morphosyntactic adaptation in Malaysian English caused the limitation.
However, interestingly, this morphosyntactic adaptation does not impact the
performance of ChatGPT for relation extraction."	ArXiv

308	Does Using ChatGPT Result in Human Cognitive Augmentation?	['Ron Fulbright', 'Miranda Morrison']	2024-01-19 22:04:50+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11042v1	"Human cognitive performance is enhanced by the use of tools. For example, a
human can produce a much greater, and more accurate, volume of mathematical
calculation in a unit of time using a calculator or a spreadsheet application
on a computer. Such tools have taken over the burden of lower level cognitive
grunt work but the human still serves the role of the expert performing higher
level thinking and reasoning. Recently, however, unsupervised, deep, machine
learning has produced cognitive systems able to outperform humans in several
domains. When humans use these tools in a human cog ensemble, the cognitive
ability of the human is augmented. In some cases, even non experts can achieve,
and even exceed, the performance of experts in a particular domain, synthetic
expertise. A new cognitive system, ChatGPT, has burst onto the scene during the
past year. This paper investigates human cognitive augmentation due to using
ChatGPT by presenting the results of two experiments comparing responses
created using ChatGPT with results created not using ChatGPT. We find using
ChatGPT does not always result in cognitive augmentation and does not yet
replace human judgement, discernment, and evaluation in certain types of tasks.
In fact, ChatGPT was observed to result in misleading users resulting in
negative cognitive augmentation."	ArXiv

software development tools, such as ChatGPT, to aid developers in complex
tasks. Developers use ChatGPT to write code, review code changes, and even
debug their programs. In these interactions, ChatGPT often recommends code
snippets that depend on external libraries. However, code from libraries
changes over time, invalidating a once-correct code snippet and making it
difficult to reuse recommended code.
  In this study, we analyze DevGPT, a dataset of more than 4,000
Developer-ChatGPT interactions, to understand the role of library versions in
code-related conversations. We quantify how often library version constraints
are mentioned in code-related conversations and when ChatGPT recommends the
installation of specific libraries. Our findings show that, albeit to
constantly recommend and analyze code with external dependencies, library
version constraints only appear in 9% of the conversations. In the majority of
conversations, the version constraints are prompted by users (as opposed to
being specified by ChatGPT) as a method for receiving better quality responses.
Moreover, we study how library version constraints are used in the conversation
through qualitative methods, identifying several potential problems that

attention in higher education. This study aims to understand how universities
establish policies regarding the use of AI tools and explore the factors that
influence their decisions. Our study examines ChatGPT policies implemented at
universities around the world, including their existence, content, and issuance
dates. Specifically, we analyzed the top 500 universities according to the 2022
QS World University Rankings. Our findings indicate that there is significant
variation in university policies. Less than one-third of the universities
included in the study had implemented ChatGPT policies. Of the universities
with ChatGPT policies, approximately 67 percent embraced ChatGPT in teaching
and learning, more than twice the number of universities that banned it. The
majority of the universities that ban the use of ChatGPT in assessments allow
individual instructors to deviate from this restrictive policy. Our empirical
analysis identifies several factors that are significantly and positively
correlated with a university's likelihood of having a ChatGPT policy, including
the university's academic reputation score, being in an English-speaking
country, and the general public attitudes toward ChatGPT. In addition, we found
that a university's likelihood of having a ban policy is positively associated
with faculty student ratio, citations, and the English-speaking country dummy,
while negatively associated with the number of peer universities within the
same country that have banned ChatGPT. We discuss the challenges faced by
universities based our empirical findings."	ArXiv

  assessment preserving integrity"	['P G Kubendran Amos']	2023-06-03 12:12:46+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02096v1	"With the launch of ChatGPT, serious concerns have reasonably been raised of
its ill-effect on the integrity of remote take-home exams. By way of mitigating
the concern, in this study, a rather straightforward Artificial-Intelligence
(AI)-integrated take-home assessment technique is proposed, and the outcome of
its practice is discussed. Despite involving AI, in the form of ChatGPT, the
assessment adheres to the convention of posing questions invoking critical
thinking and problem solving skills. However, AI is characteristically
integrated in this assessment by instructing the learners to employ ChatGPT as
one of the primary sources. The learners are directed to report the use of
ChatGPT by including both the prompts and its responses, before expressing
their thoughts on AI-generated answers and their own concluding statement.
These three characteristic components of the present techniques -- the handling
of ChatGPT through the prompts, comments on the AI-responses and the concluding
thoughts -- are evaluated to gauge the learning.
  The proposed assessment was assigned as a take-home group activity for a
batch of seventy eight students, divided into thirteen groups. Despite
addressing the same questions, there was no significant overlap in the answers.
Moreover, a wide range of approaches were adopted by the groups in handling
ChatGPT, which in-turn rendered different responses, ultimately drawing
distinct answers. Besides preventing the undesired use of ChatGPT by explicitly
integrating it, the proposed assessment seemingly helped the learners question
the accuracy of its responses. This self-realised skepticism can be expected to
curtail blatant malpractices involving ChatGPT in the long run."	ArXiv

abilities on various natural language processing tasks, we provide a
preliminary evaluation of ChatGPT on text-based personality recognition task
for generating effective personality data. Concretely, we employ a variety of
prompting strategies to explore ChatGPT's ability in recognizing personality
from given text, especially the level-oriented prompting strategy we designed
for guiding ChatGPT in analyzing given text at a specified level. The
experimental results on two representative real-world datasets reveal that
ChatGPT with zero-shot chain-of-thought prompting exhibits impressive
personality recognition ability and is capable to provide natural language
explanations through text-based logical reasoning. Furthermore, by employing
the level-oriented prompting strategy to optimize zero-shot chain-of-thought
prompting, the performance gap between ChatGPT and corresponding
state-of-the-art model has been narrowed even more. However, we observe that
ChatGPT shows unfairness towards certain sensitive demographic attributes such

first retrieve an in-context demonstration via the retriever. Then, we require
ChatGPT to generate $k$ candidate summaries for the inference document at a
time under the guidance of the retrieved demonstration. Finally, the rank model
independently scores the $k$ candidate summaries according to their quality and
selects the optimal one. We extensively explore dense and sparse retrieval
methods to select effective demonstrations for reference and efficiently train
the rank model to reflect the quality of candidate summaries for each given
summarized document. Additionally, PADS contains merely 400M trainable
parameters originating from the rank model and we merely collect 2.5k data to
train it. We evaluate PADS on five datasets from different domains, and the
result indicates that each module in PADS is committed to effectively guiding

A Preliminary Study	['Jiaan Wang', 'Yunlong Liang', 'Fandong Meng', 'Zengkui Sun', 'Haoxiang Shi', 'Zhixu Li', 'Jinan Xu', 'Jianfeng Qu', 'Jie Zhou']	2023-03-07 16:57:20+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04048v3	"Recently, the emergence of ChatGPT has attracted wide attention from the
computational linguistics community. Many prior studies have shown that ChatGPT
achieves remarkable performance on various NLP tasks in terms of automatic
evaluation metrics. However, the ability of ChatGPT to serve as an evaluation
metric is still underexplored. Considering assessing the quality of natural
language generation (NLG) models is an arduous task and NLG metrics notoriously
show their poor correlation with human judgments, we wonder whether ChatGPT is
a good NLG evaluation metric. In this report, we provide a preliminary
meta-evaluation on ChatGPT to show its reliability as an NLG metric. In detail,
we regard ChatGPT as a human evaluator and give task-specific (e.g.,
summarization) and aspect-specific (e.g., relevance) instruction to prompt
ChatGPT to evaluate the generated results of NLG models. We conduct experiments
on five NLG meta-evaluation datasets (including summarization, story generation
and data-to-text tasks). Experimental results show that compared with previous
automatic metrics, ChatGPT achieves state-of-the-art or competitive correlation
with human judgments in most cases. In addition, we find that the effectiveness
of the ChatGPT evaluator might be influenced by the creation method of the
meta-evaluation datasets. For the meta-evaluation datasets which are created
greatly depending on the reference and thus are biased, the ChatGPT evaluator
might lose its effectiveness. We hope our preliminary study could prompt the
emergence of a general-purposed reliable NLG metric."	ArXiv

70% of hints produced by ChatGPT passed our manual quality checks and that both
human and ChatGPT conditions produced positive learning gains. However, gains
were only statistically significant for human tutor created hints. Learning
gains from human-created hints were substantially and statistically
significantly higher than ChatGPT hints in both topic areas, though ChatGPT

Several
prior studies have shown that it achieves comparable results to commercial

low-resource and distant-language-pairs translation. However, they usually
adopt simple prompts which can not fully elicit the capability of ChatGPT. In
this paper, we aim to further mine ChatGPT's translation ability by revisiting
several aspects: temperature, task information, and domain information, and
correspondingly propose an optimal temperature setting and two (simple but
effective) prompts: Task-Specific Prompts (TSP) and Domain-Specific Prompts
(DSP). We show that: 1) The performance of ChatGPT depends largely on
temperature, and a lower temperature usually can achieve better performance; 2)
Emphasizing the task information can further improve ChatGPT's performance,
particularly in complex MT tasks; 3) Introducing domain information can elicit
ChatGPT's generalization ability and improve its performance in the specific
domain; 4) ChatGPT tends to generate hallucinations for non-English-centric MT
tasks, which can be partially addressed by our proposed prompts but still need
to be highlighted for the MT/NLP community. We also explore the effects of
advanced in-context learning strategies and find a (negative but interesting)
observation: the powerful chain-of-thought prompt leads to word-by-word
translation behavior, thus bringing significant translation degradation."	ArXiv

confronted with three questions of progressing difficulty from introductory
mechanics (rolling motion, waves, and fluid dynamics). Each question was
presented with four different responses. All responses were attributed to
ChatGPT, but in reality one sample solution was created by the researchers. All
ChatGPT responses obtained in this study were wrong, imprecise, incomplete, or
misleading. We found little differences in the perceived linguistic quality
between ChatGPT responses and the sample solution. However, the students rated
the overall scientific accuracy of the responses significantly differently,
with the sample solution being rated best for the questions of low and medium
difficulty. The discrepancy between the sample solution and the ChatGPT
responses increased with the level of self-assessed knowledge of the question
content. For the question of highest difficulty (fluid dynamics) that was
unknown to most students, a ChatGPT response was rated just as good as the
sample solution. Thus, this study provides data on the students' perception of
ChatGPT responses and the factors influencing their perception. The results
highlight the need for careful evaluation of ChatGPT responses both by

revealed that ChatGPT seems to hold a bias towards progressive views. The
political compass test revealed a bias towards progressive and libertarian

solutions but falls short in fact-checking tasks. Users perceive ChatGPT's
responses as having higher information quality compared to Google Search,
despite displaying a similar level of trust in both tools. Furthermore,
participants using ChatGPT report significantly better user experiences in
terms of usefulness, enjoyment, and satisfaction, while perceived ease of use
remains comparable between the two tools. However, ChatGPT may also lead to
overreliance and generate or replicate misinformation, yielding inconsistent

know how the students can possibly use ChatGPT to complete the exercise tasks.
We input the vulnerable code to ChatGPT and measure its accuracy in
vulnerability identification and fixing. In addition, we investigated whether
ChatGPT can provide a proper source of information to support its outputs.
Results show that ChatGPT can identify 20 of the 28 vulnerabilities we inserted
in the web application in a white-box setting, reported three false positives,

limitations and suffers hallucinations, for example producing answers that look
plausible but they are completely wrong. Evaluating the performance of ChatGPT
and similar AI tools is a complex issue that is being explored from different
perspectives. In this work, we contribute to those efforts with ChatWords, an
automated test system, to evaluate ChatGPT knowledge of an arbitrary set of
words. ChatWords is designed to be extensible, easy to use, and adaptable to
evaluate also other NLP AI tools. ChatWords is publicly available and its main
goal is to facilitate research on the lexical knowledge of AI tools. The
benefits of ChatWords are illustrated with two case studies: evaluating the
knowledge that ChatGPT has of the Spanish lexicon (taken from the official
dictionary of the ""Real Academia Espa\~nola"") and of the words that appear in
the Quixote, the well-known novel written by Miguel de Cervantes. The results
show that ChatGPT is only able to recognize approximately 80% of the words in
the dictionary and 90% of the words in the Quixote, in some cases with an

extensive parameters, this model adeptly responds to a wide range of questions.
However, due to its reliance on internal knowledge, the accuracy of responses
may not be absolute. This article scrutinizes ChatGPT as a Question Answering
System (QAS), comparing its performance to other existing QASs. The primary
focus is on evaluating ChatGPT's proficiency in extracting responses from
provided paragraphs, a core QAS capability. Additionally, performance
comparisons are made in scenarios without a surrounding passage. Multiple
experiments, exploring response hallucination and considering question
complexity, were conducted on ChatGPT. Evaluation employed well-known Question
Answering (QA) datasets, including SQuAD, NewsQA, and PersianQuAD, across
English and Persian languages. Metrics such as F-score, exact match, and
accuracy were employed in the assessment. The study reveals that, while ChatGPT
demonstrates competence as a generative model, it is less effective in question
answering compared to task-specific models. Providing context improves its
performance, and prompt engineering enhances precision, particularly for
questions lacking explicit answers in provided paragraphs. ChatGPT excels at
simpler factual questions compared to ""how"" and ""why"" question types. The
evaluation highlights occurrences of hallucinations, where ChatGPT provides

Further investigation indicated that higher-ability students, as proxied by
their econometrics grades, were the ones who performed worse in writing
analysis tasks when using ChatGPT. We also found evidence that students with
better digital skills performed better with ChatGPT. This research provides

  Comprehensive Evaluation"	['Tao Fang', 'Shu Yang', 'Kaixin Lan', 'Derek F. Wong', 'Jinpeng Hu', 'Lidia S. Chao', 'Yue Zhang']	2023-04-04 12:33:40+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01746v1	"ChatGPT, a large-scale language model based on the advanced GPT-3.5
architecture, has shown remarkable potential in various Natural Language
Processing (NLP) tasks. However, there is currently a dearth of comprehensive
study exploring its potential in the area of Grammatical Error Correction
(GEC). To showcase its capabilities in GEC, we design zero-shot
chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot CoT settings using in-context learning for
ChatGPT. Our evaluation involves assessing ChatGPT's performance on five
official test sets in three different languages, along with three
document-level GEC test sets in English. Our experimental results and human
evaluations demonstrate that ChatGPT has excellent error detection capabilities
and can freely correct errors to make the corrected sentences very fluent,
possibly due to its over-correction tendencies and not adhering to the
principle of minimal edits. Additionally, its performance in non-English and
low-resource settings highlights its potential in multilingual GEC tasks.
However, further analysis of various types of errors at the document-level has
shown that ChatGPT cannot effectively correct agreement, coreference, tense
errors across sentences, and cross-sentence boundary errors."	ArXiv

  MultiModal Stock Movement Prediction Challenges"	['Qianqian Xie', 'Weiguang Han', 'Yanzhao Lai', 'Min Peng', 'Jimin Huang']	2023-04-10 04:31:00+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05351v2	"Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated
remarkable performance across a variety of natural language processing tasks.
However, their effectiveness in the financial domain, specifically in
predicting stock market movements, remains to be explored. In this paper, we
conduct an extensive zero-shot analysis of ChatGPT's capabilities in multimodal
stock movement prediction, on three tweets and historical stock price datasets.
Our findings indicate that ChatGPT is a ""Wall Street Neophyte"" with limited
success in predicting stock movements, as it underperforms not only
state-of-the-art methods but also traditional methods like linear regression
using price features. Despite the potential of Chain-of-Thought prompting
strategies and the inclusion of tweets, ChatGPT's performance remains subpar.
Furthermore, we observe limitations in its explainability and stability,
suggesting the need for more specialized training or fine-tuning. This research
provides insights into ChatGPT's capabilities and serves as a foundation for
future work aimed at improving financial market analysis and prediction by
leveraging social media sentiment and historical stock data."	ArXiv
395	How Secure is Code Generated by ChatGPT?	['Raphaël Khoury', 'Anderson R. Avila', 'Jacob Brunelle', 'Baba Mamadou Camara']	2023-04-19 13:45:01+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09655v1	"In recent years, large language models have been responsible for great
advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). ChatGPT in particular,
an AI chatbot developed and recently released by OpenAI, has taken the field to
the next level. The conversational model is able not only to process human-like
text, but also to translate natural language into code. However, the safety of
programs generated by ChatGPT should not be overlooked. In this paper, we
perform an experiment to address this issue. Specifically, we ask ChatGPT to
generate a number of program and evaluate the security of the resulting source
code. We further investigate whether ChatGPT can be prodded to improve the
security by appropriate prompts, and discuss the ethical aspects of using AI to
generate code. Results suggest that ChatGPT is aware of potential
vulnerabilities, but nonetheless often generates source code that are not
robust to certain attacks."	ArXiv
396	Taking Advice from ChatGPT	['Peter Zhang']	2023-05-11 15:03:15+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11888v3	"A growing literature studies how humans incorporate advice from algorithms.
This study examines an algorithm with millions of daily users: ChatGPT. In a
preregistered study, 118 student participants answer 2,828 multiple-choice
questions across 25 academic subjects. Participants receive advice from a GPT
model and can update their initial responses. The advisor's identity (""AI
chatbot"" versus a human ""expert""), presence of a written justification, and
advice correctness do not significantly affect weight on advice. Instead,
participants weigh advice more heavily if they (1) are unfamiliar with the
topic, (2) used ChatGPT in the past, or (3) received more accurate advice
previously. The last two effects -- algorithm familiarity and experience -- are
stronger with an AI chatbot as the advisor. Participants that receive written
justifications are able to discern correct advice and update accordingly.
Student participants are miscalibrated in their judgements of ChatGPT advice
accuracy; one reason is that they significantly misjudge the accuracy of
ChatGPT on 11/25 topics. Participants under-weigh advice by over 50% and can
score better by trusting ChatGPT more."	ArXiv

answer assessment. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that explores
using ChatGPT, a cutting-edge large language model, for the concurrent tasks of
student answer scoring and rationale generation. We identify the appropriate
instructions by prompting ChatGPT with different templates to collect the
rationales, where inconsistent rationales are refined to align with marking
standards. The refined ChatGPT outputs enable us to fine-tune a smaller
language model that simultaneously assesses student answers and provides
rationales. Extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset show that the
proposed method improves the overall QWK score by 11% compared to ChatGPT.
Furthermore, our thorough analysis and human evaluation demonstrate that the
rationales generated by our proposed method are comparable to those of ChatGPT.
Our approach provides a viable solution to achieve explainable automated

  ChatGPT"	['Qingxin Xia', 'Takuya Maekawa', 'Takahiro Hara']	2023-06-03 15:41:59+00:00	http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02140v1	"Wearable sensor devices, which offer the advantage of recording daily objects
used by a person while performing an activity, enable the feasibility of
unsupervised Human Activity Recognition (HAR). Unfortunately, previous
unsupervised approaches using the usage sequence of objects usually require a
proper description of activities manually prepared by humans. Instead, we
leverage the knowledge embedded in a Large Language Model (LLM) of ChatGPT.
Because the sequence of objects robustly characterizes the activity identity,
it is possible that ChatGPT already learned the association between activities
and objects from existing contexts. However, previous prompt engineering for
ChatGPT exhibits limited generalization ability when dealing with a list of
words (i.e., sequence of objects) due to the similar weighting assigned to each
word in the list. In this study, we propose a two-stage prompt engineering,
which first guides ChatGPT to generate activity descriptions associated with
objects while emphasizing important objects for distinguishing similar
activities; then outputs activity classes and explanations for enhancing the
contexts that are helpful for HAR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first study that utilizes ChatGPT to recognize activities using objects in an
unsupervised manner. We conducted our approach on three datasets and
demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance."	ArXiv
